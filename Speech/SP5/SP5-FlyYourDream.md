## Introduction
Hello, my fellow Toastmasters. When I was a little boy, I dreamed to be a pilot. Unfortunately it didn't become true. But I found something to compensate my lost dream. It is model airplane. Today I'm going to show you how it works.

I didn't make a plane from scratch, I just assembly it. These are what I started with. Usually I bought a set of basic elements, combined them together and installed electronic devices.

Now let me show you how everything work? Let's start with the wing.

## Mechanics
### Wing
== Show picture of a wing ==
This is the wing from one of my planes. Usually the wing is both long and wide. If you look from the side view, you will find the shape of a wing is carefully designed: the bottom is flat, the top is curving. This shape make it possible for the plane to be lifted when air is flowwing along the surfaces. By the way, the name airplane originated from the shape of the wing bottom which is plane, I mean flat.

##### Ailerons, Steering engine
This picture show your the back side of the wing. Look at this part, its name is aileron. It is movable, it can roll up and down. It is driven by a device named steering-engine. There are ailerons on both sides of a wing, they always act in inversed direction: Imagine, if the left aileron rolls up, the other one rolls down. Then what happen? The left side of the wing would be pressed down by the flowing air, and the other side would be pushed up. Then the gesture of the wing is like this. That is how the plane turn left.

#### Gravity Center (transfer to next topic)
A question, where do you think is the gravity center of a plance, here, or here?

### Stabilizer
Many people could choose this point, as it is between the 2 wings, the weight here would be shared by them. But it's wrong. The gravity center is right here, in the geometric center of this wing. This is not a wing, it doesn't contribute to the lifting of the plane. The name is Stabilizer. It also has a movable edge, which is known as Elevator. It controls the plane head up or head down. For example, if the elevator roll up, the tail of the plane will be pressed down, the whole body of the plane would be like this. So the plane is going to rise.

#### How does it work
== Skipped. ==

### Engine
In the front, it is the engine and the propeller. They work together to push the air back and pull the plane forward.

You can control the speed of the engine with a remote-control. This is what a controller looks like. To work with it, inside the plane, you have to install a receiver to handle the signal. The receiver, battery and other electrical devices are all installed here.

### Put everything together
Putting everything together, a model airplane is prepared.

## Fly Show
Before I finish, let me show you a short video when a plane was taking off.

Thank you.
