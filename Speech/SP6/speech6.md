# An Irish myth

## Introduction
On the northern coast of Ireland, a vast plateau extends the land into the ocean. The name of this place is Giant's Causeway. The scientific explanation of this plateau is that it was formed in a volcanic eruption, the lava flew into the water and cooled, then made this plateau, which could happened millions years ago. But an ancient Irish myth has a different accounting.

## Story
According to the legend, a gaint known as Finn MacCool and his wife Oonagh lived on the coast of Ireland. They lived there freely but not happily, because across the sea, on the coast of Scotland lived another giant, whose name was Benandonner, or The Red Man. The two giants were not friendly, although they hadn't even seen each other, before. They hated each other for no reason. They roared to the opposite side and threw big rocks over the sea to show the strength.

Finn threw many big stones to Scottish side, but many of them didn't hit the land, they fell into the sea. The Red Man also threw large stones back to Ireland, the largest one of them hit the coast and made the plateau Giant's Causeway, but others were thrown into the sea as well.

Gradually, the rocks in the sea accumulated and finally made a bridge. So the two giants had a route to meet each other. One day the Red Man challenged Finn:" Little boy, do you dare to come and fight? Keep quiet if you are scared. Haha..." Of course Finn was not scared, he replyed:" Are you kidding, red monkey. Wait for me, let me beat you to death."

Then Finn began to run forward the Red Man. But when he was on the half way, things began to change. When he was approaching the other side of the sea, he made out the figure of The Red Man from afar, he was suppressed that The Red Man was really taller and stronger than himself. He realized it was not possible to defeat The Red Man and he would be killed. So he turned back and run home.

At home, he trembled and cried to Oonagh. Oonagh was worried too. But she didn't panic, she figured out a plan. She put her husband into a huge cradle like a baby. She comforted Finn, "Honey, don't be afraid. We are going to survive. But before that, we get to do something. Listen, when the Red Man come close to you, just cry like a child."

Soon The Red Man arrived, and punched the door loudly. Then Oonagh answered door peacefully. She told the visitor that her husband wasn't home, and welcomed him to wait in the room. Just one thing, keep quiet, the baby was sleeping.

The Red Man waited for a while and felt bored, he couldn't help the curiosity to look at the baby. When he came to the cradle, he was surprised. The head of the baby was so big, the arm was so strong. Then the baby cried, the sound was impressively loud. The Red Man wondered, if the baby was as huge as this, how giant would the father be? Finally he concluded that meeting the father was not a good idea. Then he got out the house and run back home. And on the way back, The Red Man destroyed the bridge to get rid of meeting the father forever.

## Conclusion
That is the story. Who defeated The Red Man? Finn? No. Oonagh? I don't think so. The Red Man defeated himself with an illusion which didn't exist at all. In our real day life, we were also defeated by our illusions frequently. Did you ever give up something by over-imagining its difficulty? Next time, when you are worrying that a problem can be too challengeable to resolve, come back to this story and encourage yourself: This worst won't happen, the giant father won't come.

Thank you.
