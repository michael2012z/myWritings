      <dd>Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, "`Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.'</dd>

      <dd>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"What do you see, Amos?" he asked. "A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then the LORD said to me, "The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. <sup>[<a href="#footnote23">23</a>]</sup> Many, many bodies - flung everywhere! Silence!"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?" - skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: "I will never forget anything they have done.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"The days are coming," declares the Sovereign LORD, "when I will send a famine through the land - not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"In that day "the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>They who swear by the shame <sup>[<a href="#footnote24">24</a>]</sup> of Samaria, or say, `As surely as your god lives, O Dan,' or, `As surely as the god <sup>[<a href="#footnote25">25</a>]</sup> of Beersheba lives' - they will fall, never to rise again."</dd>

      <dd>I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: "Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Though they dig down to the depths of the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. I will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>The Lord, the LORD Almighty, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn - the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt - </dd>

      <dd>he who builds his lofty palace <sup>[<a href="#footnote27">27</a>]</sup> in the heavens and sets its foundation <sup>[<a href="#footnote28">28</a>]</sup> on the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land - the LORD is his name.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites <sup>[<a href="#footnote29">29</a>]</sup>?" declares the LORD. "Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor <sup>[<a href="#footnote30">30</a>]</sup> and the Arameans from Kir?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"Surely the eyes of the Sovereign LORD are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth - yet I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"For I will give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.</dd>

      <dd>All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say, `Disaster will not overtake or meet us.'</dd>
