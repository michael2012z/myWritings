      <dd>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He had seven sons and three daughters,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</dd>

      <dd>One day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> also came with them.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</dd>

      <dd>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</dd>

      <dd>He said:</dd>

      <dd>"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>That day - may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>May darkness and deep shadow <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>That night - may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</dd>

      <dd>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</dd>

      <dd>"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"I am unworthy - how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>I spoke once, but I have no answer - twice, but I will say no more."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves.

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver <sup>[<a href="#footnote106">106</a>]</sup> and a gold ring.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</dd>
