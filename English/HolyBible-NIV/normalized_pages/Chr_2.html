      <dd>Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel - to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families - </dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Solomon answered God, "You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>God said to Solomon, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.</dd>

      <dd>Solomon sent this message to Hiram <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> king of Tyre: "Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the appointed feasts of the LORD our God.

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom my father David provided.</dd>

      <dd>Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>And Hiram added: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill,</dd>

      <dd>whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre.

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Then Solomon began to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup> the Jebusite, the place provided by David.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup> (using the cubit of the old standard).</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> long across the width of the building and twenty cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He paneled the main hall with pine and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple - twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> of fine gold.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup> He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>In the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall. <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>In the front of the temple he made two pillars, which [together] were thirty-five cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup> long, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>He made interwoven chains <sup>[<a href="#footnote19">19</a>]</sup> and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin <sup>[<a href="#footnote20">20</a>]</sup> and the one to the north Boaz. <sup>[<a href="#footnote21">21</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote23">23</a>]</sup> high. It took a line of thirty cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote24">24</a>]</sup> to measure around it.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it - ten to a cubit. <sup>[<a href="#footnote25">25</a>]</sup> The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>It was a handbreadth <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths. <sup>[<a href="#footnote27">27</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.</dd>

      <dd>He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.</dd>

      <dd>He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</dd>

      <dd>the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. <sup>[<a href="#footnote28">28</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not determined.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;</dd>

      <dd>The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD's musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, "His love endures forever."

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, <sup>[<a href="#footnote31">31</a>]</sup> because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.</dd>

      <dd>In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement.

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>After Rehoboam's position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel <sup>[<a href="#footnote50">50</a>]</sup> with him abandoned the law of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites <sup>[<a href="#footnote51">51</a>]</sup> that came with him from Egypt,</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, "This is what the LORD says, `You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is just."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD's anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote52">52</a>]</sup> a daughter <sup>[<a href="#footnote53">53</a>]</sup> of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David's descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>But didn't you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel's able men.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>The men of Israel were subdued on that occasion, and the men of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.</dd>

      <dt><i>Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets - four hundred men - and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: `With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, `These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>And the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, `I will entice him.' "`By what means?' the LORD asked.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"`I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "`You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. `Go and do it.'</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from <sup>[<a href="#footnote60">60</a>]</sup> the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son,</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>and say, `This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</dd>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.</dd>

      <dd>When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, "Should you help the wicked and love <sup>[<a href="#footnote61">61</a>]</sup> those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He told them, "Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for man but for the LORD, who is with you whenever you give a verdict.</dd>

      <dd>Now let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He gave them these orders: "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>In every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the cities - whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or ordinances - you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not sin.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you.

    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites <sup>[<a href="#footnote62">62</a>]</sup> came to make war on Jehoshaphat.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, <sup>[<a href="#footnote63">63</a>]</sup> from the other side of the Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote64">64</a>]</sup> It is already in Hazazon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi).</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new courtyard</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>and said: "O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>O our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>`If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.'</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon you."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: `Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.'"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with very loud voice.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his <sup>[<a href="#footnote65">65</a>]</sup> holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: "Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>The men of Ammon and Moab rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing <sup>[<a href="#footnote66">66</a>]</sup> and also articles of value - more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is called the Valley of Beracah <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup> to this day.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lutes and trumpets.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>The fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>He walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>The other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who was guilty of wickedness.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup> After these were built at Ezion Geber,</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade. <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.</dd>

      <dd>When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father's kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: "This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: `You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But you have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your father's house, men who were better than you.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.'"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king's palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup> the youngest.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no fire in his honor, as they had for his fathers.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one's regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</dd>

      <dd>The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</dd>

      <dd>Ahaziah was twenty-two <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.</dd>

      <dd>He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.</dd>

      <dd>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father's death they became his advisers, to his undoing.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup> son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;</dd>

      <dd>While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death.

    <h2>2 Chronicles 23</h2>

    <dl compact>
      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, "The king's son shall reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>No one is to enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the other men are to guard what the LORD has assigned to them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote78">78</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men - those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty - for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king - near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, "Long live the king!"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: "Bring her out between the ranks <sup>[<a href="#footnote79">79</a>]</sup> and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king <sup>[<a href="#footnote80">80</a>]</sup> would be the LORD's people.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the hands of the priests, who were Levites, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the LORD's temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the LORD. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD's temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says: `Why do you disobey the LORD's commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.'"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>At the turn of the year, <sup>[<a href="#footnote81">81</a>]</sup> the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Those who conspired against him were Zabad, <sup>[<a href="#footnote82">82</a>]</sup> son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith <sup>[<a href="#footnote83">83</a>]</sup> a Moabite woman.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.</dd>

      <dt><i>Amaziah King of Judah</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin <sup>[<a href="#footnote84">84</a>]</sup>; she was from Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins." <sup>[<a href="#footnote85">85</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote86">86</a>]</sup> of silver.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel - not with any of the people of Ephraim.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why do you consult this people's gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>While he was still speaking, the king said to him, "Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?" So the prophet stopped but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash <sup>[<a href="#footnote87">87</a>]</sup> son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, meet me face to face."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, `Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might hand them over to [Jehoash], because they sought the gods of Edom.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup> at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate - a section about six hundred feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup> long.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>He was brought back by horse and was buried with his fathers in the City of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear <sup>[<a href="#footnote91">91</a>]</sup> of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.</dd>

      <dd>Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD's temple, leprosy <sup>[<a href="#footnote92">92</a>]</sup> broke out on his forehead.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house <sup>[<a href="#footnote93">93</a>]</sup> - leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.</dd>

      <dd>Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah - because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD's fierce anger rests on you."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then some of the leaders in Ephraim - Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai - confronted those who were arriving from the war.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"You must not bring those prisoners here," they said, "or we will be guilty before the LORD. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>At that time King Ahaz sent to the king <sup>[<a href="#footnote96">96</a>]</sup> of Assyria for help.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The LORD had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote97">97</a>]</sup> for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Tiglath-Pileser <sup>[<a href="#footnote98">98</a>]</sup> king of Assyria came to him, but he gave him trouble instead of help.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took them away. <sup>[<a href="#footnote99">99</a>]</sup> He shut the doors of the LORD's temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the LORD and repaired them.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>and said: "Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Our fathers were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the LORD our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the LORD's dwelling place and turned their backs on him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, the anger of the LORD has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Now I intend to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then these Levites set to work: from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>from the descendants of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The priests went into the sanctuary of the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the LORD's temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the LORD's altar."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs - all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their kinsmen the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote100">100</a>]</sup> and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the LORD was reestablished.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>At the king's command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: "People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Do not be like your fathers and brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; submit to the LORD. Come to the sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>If you return to the LORD, then your brothers and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will come back to this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him."</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but the people scorned and ridiculed them.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the Levites.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate [their lambs] to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the LORD, who is good, pardon everyone</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>who sets his heart on seeking God - the LORD, the God of his fathers - even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests sang to the LORD every day, accompanied by the LORD's instruments of praise. <sup>[<a href="#footnote101">101</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote102">102</a>]</sup> and praised the LORD, the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the aliens who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Conaniah, a Levite, was in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank.</dd>

      <dd>With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>When Hezekiah says, `The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, `You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Sennacherib's officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The king also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world - the work of men's hands.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them <sup>[<a href="#footnote106">106</a>]</sup> on every side.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.</dd>

      <dd>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He built altars in the temple of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He sacrificed his sons in <sup>[<a href="#footnote107">107</a>]</sup> the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>He took the carved image he had made and put it in God's temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your forefathers, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and ordinances given through Moses."</dd>

      <dd>The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>In his distress he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</dd>

      <dd>And when he prayed to him, the LORD was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote108">108</a>]</sup> and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.</dd>

      <dd>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, carved idols and cast images.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles, the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the LORD's temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The men did the work faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites - all who were skilled in playing musical instruments - </dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and doorkeepers.</dd>

      <dd>Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: "Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote111">111</a>]</sup> Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant:</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him <sup>[<a href="#footnote112">112</a>]</sup> went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, <sup>[<a href="#footnote113">113</a>]</sup> the son of Hasrah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote114">114</a>]</sup> keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>`This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people - all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made, <sup>[<a href="#footnote115">115</a>]</sup> my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, `This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites - all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the LORD: "Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the directions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle - all from the king's own possessions.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the administrators of God's temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.</dd>

      <dd>The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>So at that time the entire service of the LORD was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had ordered.</dd>

      <dd>The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</dd>
