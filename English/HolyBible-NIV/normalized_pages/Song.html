      <dd>Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> unyielding as the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup></dd>
