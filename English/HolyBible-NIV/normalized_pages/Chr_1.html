      <dd>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</dd>

      <dd>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.</dd>

      <dd>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</dd>

      <dd>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, `You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"</dd>

      <dd>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.</dd>

      <dd>said to David, "You will not get in here." Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>David had said, "Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.</dd>

      <dd>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men - they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised - </dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup> a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers <sup>[<a href="#footnote74">74</a>]</sup>; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote75">75</a>]</sup> tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</dd>

      <dd>He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed.</dd>

      <dd>Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the singers, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.</dd>

      <dd>In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote95">95</a>]</sup> of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, <sup>[<a href="#footnote96">96</a>]</sup> Aram Maacah and Zobah.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, <sup>[<a href="#footnote97">97</a>]</sup> with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.</dd>

      <dd>In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.</dd>

      <dd>David took the crown from the head of their king <sup>[<a href="#footnote98">98</a>]</sup> - its weight was found to be a talent <sup>[<a href="#footnote99">99</a>]</sup> of gold, and it was set with precious stones - and it was placed on David's head.

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"Go and tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Take your choice:</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>three years of famine, three months of being swept away <sup>[<a href="#footnote100">100</a>]</sup> before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD - days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah <sup>[<a href="#footnote101">101</a>]</sup> the Jebusite.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote102">102</a>]</sup> of gold for the site.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. <sup>[<a href="#footnote103">103</a>]</sup> He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>"I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote105">105</a>]</sup> of gold, a million talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote106">106</a>]</sup> of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone.

      <dd>These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites - one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.</dd>

      <dd>David summoned all the officials of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem: the officers over the tribes, the commanders of the divisions in the service of the king, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the mighty men and all the brave warriors.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>King David rose to his feet and said: "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>But God said to me, `You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.'</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>"Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah he chose my family, and from my father's sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Of all my sons - and the LORD has given me many - he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He said to me: `Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.'</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary. Be strong and do the work."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the LORD and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the LORD, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service:</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables;</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish;</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and shelter the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"All this," David said, "I have in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>David also said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the LORD is finished.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing man skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command."</dd>

      <dd>Then King David said to the whole assembly: "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple:</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>three thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote120">120</a>]</sup> of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote121">121</a>]</sup> of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote122">122</a>]</sup> and ten thousand darics <sup>[<a href="#footnote123">123</a>]</sup> of gold, ten thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote124">124</a>]</sup> of silver, eighteen thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote125">125</a>]</sup> of bronze and a hundred thousand talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote126">126</a>]</sup> of iron.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly. <a name=29.10></a></dd>

      <dd>David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So they all praised the LORD, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the LORD and the king.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and presented burnt offerings to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>All the officers and mighty men, as well as all of King David's sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.</dd>
