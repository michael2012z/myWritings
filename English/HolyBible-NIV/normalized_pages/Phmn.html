      <dd>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul - an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus - </dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> who became my son while I was in chains.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>I am sending him - who is my very heart - back to you.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good - </dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back - not to mention that you owe me your very self.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</dd>
