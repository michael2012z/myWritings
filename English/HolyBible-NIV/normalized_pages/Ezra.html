      <dd>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: "`The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Anyone of his people among you - may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.'"</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites - everyone whose heart God had moved - prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god. <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>This was the inventory: gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1,000 silver pans 29 <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dd>The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.</dd>

      <dd>Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and the royal revenues will suffer.</dd>

      <dd>Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.</dd>

      <dd>A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: Memorandum:</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be ninety feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> high and ninety feet wide,</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.</dd>

      <dd>Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from there.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: The expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Whatever is needed - young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem - must be given them daily without fail,</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.</dd>

      <dd>So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.</dd>

      <dd>For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>For seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria, so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.</dd>

      <dd>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.</dd>

      <dd>So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his kinsmen, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 men.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>They also brought 220 of the temple servants - a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.</dd>

      <dd>I weighed out to them 650 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote24">24</a>]</sup> of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, <sup>[<a href="#footnote25">25</a>]</sup> 100 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> of gold,</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.</dd>

      <dd>From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.</dd>

      <dd>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.</dd>
