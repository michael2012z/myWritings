      <dd>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God - </dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>and who through the Spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dd>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong - </dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> <a name=1.18></a></dd>

      <dd>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised. Amen.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>God "will give to each person according to what he has done." <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>For God does not show favoritism.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished - </dd>

      <dd>he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</dd>

      <dd>Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,</dd>

      <dd>since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about - but not before God.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him." <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring - not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>As it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." <sup>[<a href="#footnote19">19</a>]</sup> He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed - the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be." <sup>[<a href="#footnote20">20</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead - since he was about a hundred years old - and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness - for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</dd>

      <dd>Do you not know, brothers - for I am speaking to men who know the law - that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." <sup>[<a href="#footnote27">27</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. <sup>[<a href="#footnote28">28</a>]</sup> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</dd>

      <dd>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</dd>

      <dd>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</dd>

      <dd>the sinful mind <sup>[<a href="#footnote34">34</a>]</sup> is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: "The man who does these things will live by them." <sup>[<a href="#footnote55">55</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?' <sup>[<a href="#footnote56">56</a>]</sup>" (that is, to bring Christ down)</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"or `Who will descend into the deep?' <sup>[<a href="#footnote57">57</a>]</sup>" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," <sup>[<a href="#footnote58">58</a>]</sup> that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." <sup>[<a href="#footnote59">59</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile - the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." <sup>[<a href="#footnote60">60</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" <sup>[<a href="#footnote61">61</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" <sup>[<a href="#footnote62">62</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." <sup>[<a href="#footnote63">63</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding." <sup>[<a href="#footnote64">64</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me." <sup>[<a href="#footnote65">65</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah - how he appealed to God against Israel:</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me" <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup>?</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever." <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</dd>

      <dd>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup> on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to your name." <sup>[<a href="#footnote90">90</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people." <sup>[<a href="#footnote91">91</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you peoples." <sup>[<a href="#footnote92">92</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will hope in him." <sup>[<a href="#footnote93">93</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done - </dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Rather, as it is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand." <sup>[<a href="#footnote94">94</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you,</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant <sup>[<a href="#footnote95">95</a>]</sup> of the church in Cenchrea.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Greet Priscilla <sup>[<a href="#footnote96">96</a>]</sup> and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with them.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. <sup>[<a href="#footnote97">97</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him - </dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.</dd>
