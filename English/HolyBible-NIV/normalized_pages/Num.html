      <dt>51</dt>

      <dd>Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death.</dd>

      <dd>The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard.</dd>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses,</dd>

      <dd>Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations."</dd>

      <dd>So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Moses answered them, "Wait until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you."</dd>

      <dd>But if a man who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, that person must be cut off from his people because he did not present the LORD's offering at the appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes.</dd>

      <dd>If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us."</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down.</dd>

      <dd>The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat!</dd>

      <dd>We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost - also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, `Give us meat to eat!'</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now - if I have found favor in your eyes - and do not let me face my own ruin."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Tell the people: `Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>but for a whole month - until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it - because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, `I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again. <sup>[<a href="#footnote22">22</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the Tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It brought them <sup>[<a href="#footnote23">23</a>]</sup> down all around the camp to about three feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote24">24</a>]</sup> above the ground, as far as a day's walk in any direction.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. <sup>[<a href="#footnote25">25</a>]</sup> Then they spread them out all around the camp.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> because there they buried the people who had craved other food.</dd>

      <dd>Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam - leprous, <sup>[<a href="#footnote27">27</a>]</sup> like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.</dd>

      <dd>When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, <sup>[<a href="#footnote29">29</a>]</sup> they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites - Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth - became insolent <sup>[<a href="#footnote38">38</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites!</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of <sup>[<a href="#footnote39">39</a>]</sup> these men? No, we will not come!"</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow - you and they and Aaron.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it - 250 censers in all - and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Moses,</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>"Say to the assembly, `Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote40">40</a>]</sup> then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses,</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy - </dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>and the LORD said to Moses,</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."</dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.</dd>

      <dt>48</dt>

      <dd>He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.</dd>

      <dt>49</dt>

      <dd>But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.</dd>

      <dt>50</dt>

      <dd>Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped.</dd>

      <dd>The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. They approached</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly, and said,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"Our father died in the desert. He was not among Korah's followers, who banded together against the LORD, but he died for his own sin and left no sons.</dd>

      <dd>Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father's relatives."</dd>

      <dd>and the LORD said to him,</dd>

      <dd>"What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and turn their father's inheritance over to them.</dd>

      <dd>"Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people."</dd>

      <dd>So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites and to carry out the LORD's vengeance on them.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel."</dd>

      <dd>Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Moses was angry with the officers of the army - the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds - who returned from the battle.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>"Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD's people.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses:</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp."</dd>

      <dd>The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon - </dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel - are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, "Shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here?</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Why do you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the LORD has given them?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>The LORD's anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>`Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - </dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.'</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The LORD's anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>"And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the desert, and you will be the cause of their destruction."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then they came up to him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>But we are ready to arm ourselves and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his inheritance.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses said to them, "If you will do this - if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>and if all of you will go armed over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him - </dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>"But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says."</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan."</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>The Gadites and Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has said.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan."</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan - the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then at the LORD's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>So Zelophehad's daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses.</dd>

      <dd>Zelophehad's daughters - Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah - married their cousins on their father's side.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's clan and tribe.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>
