      <dd>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He was with God in the beginning.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> it.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God - </dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>children born not of natural descent, <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</dd>

      <dd>Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup>"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, `Make straight the way for the Lord.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Now some Pharisees who had been sent</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>"I baptize with <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</dd>

      <dd>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>"Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</dd>

      <dd>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name. <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.</dd>

      <dd>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.</dd>

      <dd>He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup>"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup> gives birth to spirit.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.</dd>

      <dd>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, <sup>[<a href="#footnote22">22</a>]</sup> that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup>[<a href="#footnote23">23</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Now he had to go through Samaria.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. <sup>[<a href="#footnote29">29</a>]</sup>)</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</dd>

      <dd>The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."</dd>

      <dd>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</dd>

      <dd>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</dd>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda <sup>[<a href="#footnote31">31</a>]</sup> and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie - the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup>[<a href="#footnote32">32</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, `Pick up your mat and walk.'"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>and come out - those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</dd>

      <dd>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),</dd>

      <dd>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The Jewish Passover Feast was near.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages <sup>[<a href="#footnote35">35</a>]</sup> would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."</dd>

      <dd>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</dd>

      <dd>After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."</dd>

      <dd>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, <sup>[<a href="#footnote36">36</a>]</sup> they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.</dd>

      <dd>But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."</dd>

      <dd>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</dd>

      <dd>"Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."</dd>

      <dd>But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</dd>

      <dd>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</dd>

      <dd>At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, `I came down from heaven'?"</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.</dd>

      <dd>"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>It is written in the Prophets: `They will all be taught by God.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote38">38</a>]</sup> Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</dd>

      <dd>After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>You go to the Feast. I am not yet <sup>[<a href="#footnote40">40</a>]</sup> going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>"You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote41">41</a>]</sup>?</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>What did he mean when he said, `You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and `Where I am, you cannot come'?"</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>Whoever believes in me, as <sup>[<a href="#footnote42">42</a>]</sup> the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family <sup>[<a href="#footnote43">43</a>]</sup> and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</dd>

      <dd>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</dd>

      <dd>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.</dd>

      <dd>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote50">50</a>]</sup> would be put out of the synagogue.</dd>

      <dd>He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</dd>

      <dd>Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</dd>

      <dd>and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote58">58</a>]</sup> the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."</dd>

      <dd>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</dd>

      <dd>The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! <sup>[<a href="#footnote62">62</a>]</sup>" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" <sup>[<a href="#footnote63">63</a>]</sup> "Blessed is the King of Israel!"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." <sup>[<a href="#footnote64">64</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"</dd>

      <dd>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? `Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote65">65</a>]</sup> will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?"</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</dd>

      <dd>Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" <sup>[<a href="#footnote66">66</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn - and I would heal them." <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</dd>

      <dd>When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.</dd>

      <dd>It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"You call me `Teacher' and `Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</dd>

      <dd>When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?"</dd>

      <dd>"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)</dd>

      <dd>When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go."</dd>

      <dd>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me." <sup>[<a href="#footnote81">81</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</dd>

      <dd>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."</dd>

      <dd>"If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"</dd>

      <dd>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>"You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."</dd>

      <dd>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</dd>

      <dd>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</dd>

      <dd>and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"</dd>

      <dd>and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</dd>

      <dd>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</dd>

      <dd>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</dd>

      <dd>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</dd>

      <dd>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</dd>

      <dd>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</dd>

      <dt><i>Jesus and the Miraculous Catch of Fish</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup> It happened this way:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</dd>
