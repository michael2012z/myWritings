      <dd>As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions - it is by grace you have been saved.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - </dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>not by works, so that no one can boast.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,</dd>

      <dd>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.</dd>

      <dd>In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.</dd>

      <dd>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles - </dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</dd>

      <dd>according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</dd>

      <dd>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.</dd>

      <dd>As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>one Lord, one faith, one baptism;</dd>

      <dd>one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>This is why it <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men." <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.</dd>

      <dd>You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.</dd>

      <dd>Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;</dd>

      <dd>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.</dd>

      <dd>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</dd>

      <dd>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.</dd>
