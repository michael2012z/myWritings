      <dd>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"Ah, Sovereign LORD," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am only a child."</dd>

      <dd>The word of the LORD came to me:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: "`I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert, through a land not sown.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,'" declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD says: "What fault did your fathers find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>They did not ask, `Where is the LORD, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drought and darkness, <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> a land where no one travels and no one lives?'</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The priests did not ask, `Where is the LORD?' Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Therefore I bring charges against you again," declares the LORD. "And I will bring charges against your children's children.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Cross over to the coasts of Kittim <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> and look, send to Kedar <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:</dd>

      <dd>Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> Glory for worthless idols.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great horror," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Also, the men of Memphis <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head. <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>"Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, `I will not serve you!' Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, `It's no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.'</dd>

      <dd>"As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced - they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>They say to wood, `You are my father,' and to stone, `You gave me birth.' They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, `Come and save us!'</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>"Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>"In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>"You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD: "Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, `We are free to roam; we will come to you no more'?</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.</dd>

      <dd>you say, `I am innocent; he is not angry with me.' But I will pass judgment on you because you say, `I have not sinned.'</dd>

      <dd>Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.</dd>

      <dd>In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>Go, proclaim this message toward the north: "`Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD, `I will frown on you no longer, for I am merciful,' declares the LORD, `I will not be angry forever.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Only acknowledge your guilt - you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,'" declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>In those days the house of Judah will join the house of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your forefathers as an inheritance.</dd>

      <dd>O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>"Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Cursed is the man who does not obey the terms of this covenant - </dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>the terms I commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.' I said, `Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey' - the land you possess today." I answered, "Amen, LORD."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: `Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>From the time I brought your forefathers up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, "Obey me."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.'"</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to me, "There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>They have returned to the sins of their forefathers, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers.</dd>

      <dd>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>You have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.'</dd>

      <dd>The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said:</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>`This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians <sup>[<a href="#footnote38">38</a>]</sup> who are outside the wall besieging you.

      <dd>After that, declares the LORD, I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives.

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD's house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the LORD. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from his evil way. Then I will relent and not bring on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Say to them, `This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened),</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth.'"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, "You must die!</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Why do you prophesy in the LORD's name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?" And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the LORD and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's house.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the LORD your God. Then the LORD will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, `This is what the LORD Almighty says: "`Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote55">55</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the LORD and seek his favor? And did not the LORD relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>(Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt, along with some other men.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.</dd>

      <dd>So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, `You will not serve the king of Babylon.'</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, "Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the LORD has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Then I said to the priests and all these people, "This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, `Very soon now the articles from the LORD's house will be brought back from Babylon.' They are prophesying lies to you.</dd>

      <dd>Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin?</dd>

      <dd>In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:</dd>

      <dd>Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He said, "Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.</dd>

      <dd>and he said before all the people, "This is what the LORD says: `In the same way will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.'" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"Go and tell Hananiah, `This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.</dd>

      <dd>This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.'"</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.</dd>

      <dd>this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the LORD, because he has preached rebellion against me.'"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>How awful that day will be! None will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.</dd>

      <dd>"Hear the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: `He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.'</dd>

      <dd>Then maidens will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.</dd>

      <dd>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, `This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hands of the Babylonians <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup> but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.'"</dd>

      <dd>Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, `Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.'</dd>

      <dd>"Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, `Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.' "I knew that this was the word of the LORD;</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup> of silver.</dd>

      <dd>I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales.</dd>

      <dd>I took the deed of purchase - the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy - </dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions:</dd>

      <dd>For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.'</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty,</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to all the ways of men; you reward everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, both in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>You gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster upon them.</dd>

      <dd>The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>They set up their abominable idols in the house that bears my Name and defiled it.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup> to Molech, though I never commanded, nor did it enter my mind, that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>"You are saying about this city, `By the sword, famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon'; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</dd>

      <dd>While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, `This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.</dd>

      <dd>you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your fathers, the former kings who preceded you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, "Alas, O master!" I myself make this promise, declares the LORD.'"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out - Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.</dd>

      <dd>Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Jew in bondage.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said,</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>`Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you. After he has served you six years, you must let him go free.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote76">76</a>]</sup> Your fathers, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to his countrymen. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom for your fellow countrymen. So I now proclaim `freedom' for you, declares the LORD - `freedom' to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>The men who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>I will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there."</dd>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Go to the Recabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the LORD and give them wine to drink."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons - the whole family of the Recabites.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family and said to them, "Drink some wine."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command: `Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.'</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>We have obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab son of Recab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab commanded us.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, `Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian <sup>[<a href="#footnote77">77</a>]</sup> and Aramean armies.' So we have remained in Jerusalem."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, `Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>`Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, "Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers." But you have not paid attention or listened to me.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.'</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>"Therefore, this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: `Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Recabites, "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: `You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.'</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am restricted; I cannot go to the LORD's temple.</dd>

      <dd>So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, `This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?"</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'"</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.</dd>

      <dd>So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.</dd>

      <dd>"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city."</dd>

      <dd>Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, "Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did so,</dd>

      <dd>and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: `If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.</dd>

      <dd>This is how Jerusalem was taken:</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, the city wall was broken through.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim <sup>[<a href="#footnote86">86</a>]</sup> a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah. <sup>[<a href="#footnote87">87</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>But the Babylonian <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup> army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The Babylonians <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup> set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard:</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>"Take him and look after him; don't harm him but do for him whatever he asks."</dd>

      <dd>sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him:</dd>

      <dd>The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, "The LORD your God decreed this disaster for this place.</dd>

      <dd>However, before Jeremiah turned to go, <sup>[<a href="#footnote90">90</a>]</sup> Nebuzaradan added, "Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please." Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go.</dd>

      <dd>they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah - Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah <sup>[<a href="#footnote91">91</a>]</sup> the son of the Maacathite, and their men.</dd>

      <dd>Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote92">92</a>]</sup>" he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.</dd>

      <dd>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian <sup>[<a href="#footnote93">93</a>]</sup> soldiers who were there.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.</dd>

      <dd>This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt - in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis <sup>[<a href="#footnote100">100</a>]</sup> - and in Upper Egypt <sup>[<a href="#footnote101">101</a>]</sup>:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, `Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!'</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your fathers.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present - a large assembly - and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, <sup>[<a href="#footnote102">102</a>]</sup> said to Jeremiah,</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD!</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The women added, "When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?"</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"Did not the LORD remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your fathers, your kings and your officials and the people of the land?</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see."</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said, `We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.' "Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows!</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>But hear the word of the LORD, all Jews living in Egypt: `I swear by my great name,' says the LORD, `that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, "As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives."</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand - mine or theirs.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>"`This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,' declares the LORD, `so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.'</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD says: `I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.'"</dd>

      <dd>This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Concerning Egypt: This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>"Prepare your shields, both large and small, and march out for battle!</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Harness the horses, mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears, put on your armor!</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>What do I see? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back, and there is terror on every side," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Who is this that rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. She says, `I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their people.'</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Charge, O horses! Drive furiously, O charioteers! March on, O warriors - men of Cush <sup>[<a href="#footnote103">103</a>]</sup> and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>But that day belongs to the Lord, the LORD Almighty - a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour till it is satisfied, till it has quenched its thirst with blood.

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The nations will hear of your shame; your cries will fill the earth. One warrior will stumble over another; both will fall down together."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>This is the message the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt:</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>"Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it also in Memphis <sup>[<a href="#footnote104">104</a>]</sup> and Tahpanhes: `Take your positions and get ready, for the sword devours those around you.'</dd>

      <dd>Pack your belongings for exile, you who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>"Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly is coming against her from the north.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The mercenaries in her ranks are like fattened calves. They too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of disaster is coming upon them, the time for them to be punished.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as the enemy advances in force; they will come against her with axes, like men who cut down trees.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>They will chop down her forest," declares the LORD, "dense though it be. They are more numerous than locusts, they cannot be counted.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to the people of the north."</dd>

      <dd>The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes, <sup>[<a href="#footnote105">105</a>]</sup> on Pharaoh, on Egypt and her gods and her kings, and on those who rely on Pharaoh.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>"Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, `Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.'</dd>

      <dd>The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her.</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no man travels.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>"Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.</dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her.</dd>

      <dt>48</dt>

      <dd>Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>49</dt>

      <dd>"Babylon must fall because of Israel's slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>50</dt>

      <dd>You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and think on Jerusalem."</dd>

      <dt>51</dt>

      <dd>"We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house."</dd>

      <dt>52</dt>

      <dd>"But days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.</dd>

      <dt>53</dt>

      <dd>Even if Babylon reaches the sky and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her," declares the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>54</dt>

      <dd>"The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. <sup>[<a href="#footnote130">130</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>55</dt>

      <dd>The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves [of enemies] will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound.</dd>

      <dt>56</dt>

      <dd>A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full.</dd>

      <dt>57</dt>

      <dd>I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.</dd>

      <dt>58</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames."</dd>

      <dt>59</dt>

      <dd>This is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign.</dd>

      <dt>60</dt>

      <dd>Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon - all that had been recorded concerning Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>61</dt>

      <dd>He said to Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.</dd>

      <dt>62</dt>

      <dd>Then say, `O LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.'</dd>

      <dt>63</dt>

      <dd>When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates.</dd>

      <dt>64</dt>

      <dd>Then say, `So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will fall.'" The words of Jeremiah end here.</dd>

    <h2>Jeremiah 52</h2>

    <dl compact>
      <dt><i>The Fall of Jerusalem</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>It was because of the LORD's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They camped outside the city and built siege works all around it.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians <sup>[<a href="#footnote131">131</a>]</sup> were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote132">132</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>but the Babylonian <sup>[<a href="#footnote133">133</a>]</sup> army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen <sup>[<a href="#footnote134">134</a>]</sup> and those who had gone over to the king of Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings - all that were made of pure gold or silver.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference <sup>[<a href="#footnote135">135</a>]</sup>; each was four fingers thick, and hollow.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>The bronze capital on top of the one pillar was five cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote136">136</a>]</sup> high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard. There were 4,600 people in all.</dd>

      <dt><br>
        <i>Jehoiachin Released</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Evil-Merodach <sup>[<a href="#footnote137">137</a>]</sup> became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king's table.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.</dd>
