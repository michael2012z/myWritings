      <dd>The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth - and not I only, but also all who know the truth - </dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</dd>
