      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>and worked them ruthlessly.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> saying, "I drew him out of the water."</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight - why the bush does not burn up."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey - the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> will worship God on this mountain."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, `The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, `What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> This is what you are to say to the Israelites: `I AM has sent me to you.'"</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, `The LORD, <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> the God of your fathers - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob - has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, `The LORD, the God of your fathers - the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites - a land flowing with milk and honey.'</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, `The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>"And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."</dd>

      <dd>The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</dd>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob - has appeared to you."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup> like snow.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</dd>

      <dd>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</dd>

      <dd>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</dd>

      <dd>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</dd>

      <dd>But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</dd>

      <dd>Then say to Pharaoh, `This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,</dd>

      <dd>Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</dd>

      <dd>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, `Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses,</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, `At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>This is what the LORD has commanded: `Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer <sup>[<a href="#footnote32">32</a>]</sup> for each person you have in your tent.'"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much - two omers <sup>[<a href="#footnote33">33</a>]</sup> for each person - and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: `Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you <sup>[<a href="#footnote34">34</a>]</sup> refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>So the people rested on the seventh day.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>The people of Israel called the bread manna. <sup>[<a href="#footnote35">35</a>]</sup> It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>`You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,</dd>

      <dd>you <sup>[<a href="#footnote41">41</a>]</sup> will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."</dd>

      <dd>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</dd>

      <dd>Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."</dd>

      <dd>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods <sup>[<a href="#footnote97">97</a>]</sup> who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, <sup>[<a href="#footnote98">98</a>]</sup> O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. <sup>[<a href="#footnote99">99</a>]</sup> Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, `These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Why should the Egyptians say, `It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: `I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>They said to me, `Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>So I told them, `Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>But now, please forgive their sin - but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.</dd>

      <dt><i>Setting Up the Tabernacle</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Moses:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the first month.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>"Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</dd>

      <dt><br>
        <i>The Glory of the LORD</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out - until the day it lifted.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels.</dd>
