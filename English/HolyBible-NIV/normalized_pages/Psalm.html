      <dd>The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One. <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>Psalm 10 <sup>[<a href="#footnote22">22</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>He boasts of the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>In his pride the wicked does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>His ways are always prosperous; he is haughty and your laws are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He says to himself, "Nothing will shake me; I'll always be happy and never have trouble."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent, watching in secret for his victims.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He says to himself, "God has forgotten; he covers his face and never sees."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, "He won't call me to account"?</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.</dd>

      <dd>Psalm 18 For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. He sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>I love you, O LORD, my strength.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote33">33</a>]</sup> of my salvation, my stronghold.</dd>

      <dd>In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them - to the LORD, but he did not answer.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets.</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.</dd>

      <dd>A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.</dd>

      <dd>Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.</dd>

      <dd>They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup>[<a href="#footnote136">136</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>From their callous hearts comes iniquity <sup>[<a href="#footnote137">137</a>]</sup>; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup>[<a href="#footnote138">138</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>This is what the wicked are like - always carefree, they increase in wealth.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.</dd>

      <dd>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</dd>

      <dd>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed - Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</dd>

      <dd>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.</dd>

      <dd>I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint.&nbsp; <i>Selah</i></dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired:</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</dd>

      <dd>Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old - </dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>They would not be like their forefathers - a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>They did not remember his power - the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</dd>

      <dt>48</dt>

      <dd>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</dd>

      <dt>49</dt>

      <dd>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility - a band of destroying angels.</dd>

      <dt>50</dt>

      <dd>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</dd>

      <dt>51</dt>

      <dd>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</dd>

      <dt>52</dt>

      <dd>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</dd>

      <dt>53</dt>

      <dd>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</dd>

      <dt>54</dt>

      <dd>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</dd>

      <dt>55</dt>

      <dd>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</dd>

      <dt>56</dt>

      <dd>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</dd>

      <dt>57</dt>

      <dd>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</dd>

      <dt>58</dt>

      <dd>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</dd>

      <dt>59</dt>

      <dd>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</dd>

      <dt>60</dt>

      <dd>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</dd>

      <dt>61</dt>

      <dd>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</dd>

      <dt>62</dt>

      <dd>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</dd>

      <dt>63</dt>

      <dd>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</dd>

      <dt>64</dt>

      <dd>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</dd>

      <dt>65</dt>

      <dd>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</dd>

      <dt>66</dt>

      <dd>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</dd>

      <dt>67</dt>

      <dd>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</dd>

      <dt>68</dt>

      <dd>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</dd>

      <dt>69</dt>

      <dd>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</dd>

      <dt>70</dt>

      <dd>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</dd>

      <dt>71</dt>

      <dd>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</dd>

      <dt>72</dt>

      <dd>Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</dd>

      <dd>You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</dd>

      <dd>Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</dd>

      <dd>Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</dd>

      <dd>Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,</dd>

      <dd>for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>O LORD, I call to you; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers; let me not eat of their delicacies.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Let a righteous man <sup>[<a href="#footnote224">224</a>]</sup> strike me - it is a kindness; let him rebuke me - it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>[They will say,] "As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote225">225</a>]</sup>"</dd>

      <dd>But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge - do not give me over to death.</dd>

      <dd>Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, from the traps set by evildoers.</dd>
