      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</dd>

      <dd>Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly - my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> as well - the delights of the heart of man.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.</dd>

      <dt><br>
        <i>Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!</dd>

      <dt><br>
        <i>Toil Is Meaningless</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</dd>

      <dd>I have seen the burden God has laid on men.</dd>

      <dd>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.</dd>

      <dd>I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil - this is the gift of God.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment - wickedness was there, in the place of justice - wickedness was there.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>I thought in my heart, "God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup>; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.</dd>

      <dd>But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless - a miserable business!</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:</dd>

      <dd>It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all [extremes]. <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.</dd>

      <dd>Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you - </dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Obey the king's command, I say, because you took an oath before God.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Since a king's word is supreme, who can say to him, "What are you doing?"</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a man's misery weighs heavily upon him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>No man has power over the wind to contain it <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup>; so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> hurt.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Then too, I saw the wicked buried - those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup> in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe man's labor on earth - his eyes not seeing sleep day or night - </dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.</dd>

      <dt><i>A Common Destiny for All</i></dt>
    </dl>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>All share a common destiny - the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup> the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Anyone who is among the living has hope <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> - even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun - all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.</dd>

      <dd></dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</dd>

      <dd>If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness - </dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> and whose princes feast in the morning.</dd>
