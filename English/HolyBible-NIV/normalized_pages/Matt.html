      <dd>This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> because he will save his people from their sins."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> from the east came to Jerusalem</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> and have come to worship him."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> was to be born.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"`But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup>"</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</dd>

      <dd>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."</dd>

      <dd>Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"</dd>

      <dd>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Which is easier: to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up and walk'?</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."</dd>

      <dd>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, <sup>[<a href="#footnote48">48</a>]</sup> the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</dd>

      <dd>"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</dd>

      <dd>And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>"Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.</dd>

      <dd>The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop - a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He who has ears, let him hear."</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>He replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>This is why I speak to them in parables: "Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "`You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote52">52</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."</dd>

      <dd>Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>"`No,' he answered, `because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches."</dd>

      <dd>He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount <sup>[<a href="#footnote53">53</a>]</sup> of flour until it worked all through the dough."</dd>

      <dd>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.</dd>

      <dd>and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Finally, the woman died.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>But about the resurrection of the dead - have you not read what God said to you,</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' <sup>[<a href="#footnote95">95</a>]</sup>? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>This is the first and greatest commandment.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>And the second is like it: `Love your neighbor as yourself.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote97">97</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>"Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>For many will come in my name, claiming, `I am the Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote104">104</a>]</sup>' and will deceive many.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>All these are the beginning of birth pains.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>"So when you see standing in the holy place `the abomination that causes desolation,' <sup>[<a href="#footnote105">105</a>]</sup> spoken of through the prophet Daniel - let the reader understand - </dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</dd>

      <dd>Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.</dd>

      <dd>For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now - and never to be equaled again.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>At that time if anyone says to you, `Look, here is the Christ!' or, `There he is!' do not believe it.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect - if that were possible.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>See, I have told you ahead of time.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>"So if anyone tells you, `There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, `Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.</dd>

      <dd>So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."</dd>

      <dd>"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"</dd>

      <dd>All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"</dd>

      <dd>From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.</dd>

      <dd>About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, <sup>[<a href="#footnote118">118</a>]</sup> lama sabachthani?" - which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" <sup>[<a href="#footnote119">119</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."</dd>

      <dt>48</dt>

      <dd>Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.</dd>

      <dt>49</dt>

      <dd>The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."</dd>

      <dt>50</dt>

      <dd>And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</dd>

      <dt>51</dt>

      <dd>At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.</dd>

      <dt>52</dt>

      <dd>The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.</dd>

      <dt>53</dt>

      <dd>They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.</dd>

      <dt>54</dt>

      <dd>When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son <sup>[<a href="#footnote120">120</a>]</sup> of God!"</dd>

      <dt>55</dt>

      <dd>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.</dd>

      <dd>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</dd>

      <dd>As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>58</dt>

      <dd>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</dd>

      <dt>59</dt>

      <dd>Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</dd>

      <dt>60</dt>

      <dd>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</dd>

      <dd>"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, `After three days I will rise again.'</dd>

      <dt>64</dt>

      <dd>So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."</dd>

      <dt>65</dt>

      <dd>"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."</dd>

      <dd>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: `He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."</dd>

      <dd>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>telling them, "You are to say, `His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.</dd>

      <dd>When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.</dd>
