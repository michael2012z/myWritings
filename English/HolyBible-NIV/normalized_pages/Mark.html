      <dd>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> - </dd>

      <dd>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</dd>

      <dd>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</dd>

      <dd>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</dd>

      <dd>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching - and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</dd>

      <dd>The whole town gathered at the door,</dd>

      <dd>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</dd>

      <dt>1</dt>

      <dd>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up, take your mat and walk'?</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</dd>

      <dd>"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</dd>

      <dd>The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</dd>

      <dd>In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</dd>

      <dd>Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</dd>

      <dd>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</dd>

      <dd>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</dd>

      <dd>Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man - and told about the pigs as well.</dd>

      <dd>Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</dd>

      <dd>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</dd>

      <dd>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</dd>

      <dd>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</dd>

      <dd>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, `Who touched me?'"</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>He took her by the hand and said to her, &lt;"Talitha koum!"> (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</dd>

      <dd>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</dd>

      <dd>But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup>; yet he liked to listen to him.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</dd>

      <dd>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</dd>

      <dd>She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</dd>

      <dd>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</dd>

      <dd>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</dd>

      <dd>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</dd>

      <dd>They all ate and were satisfied,</dd>

      <dd>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</dd>

      <dd>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</dd>

      <dd>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</dd>

      <dd>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</dd>

      <dd>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.

      <dd>[<a href="#footnote79">79</a>] When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.</dd>
