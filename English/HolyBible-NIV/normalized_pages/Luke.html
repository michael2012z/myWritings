      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous - to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</dd>

      <dd>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> the Son of God.</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>For nothing is impossible with God."</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</dd>

      <dd>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</dd>

      <dd>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</dd>

      <dd>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>And everyone went to his own town to register.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> the Lord.</dd>

      <dd>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</dd>

      <dd>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</dd>

      <dd>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</dd>

      <dd>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</dd>

      <dd>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</dd>

      <dd>The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</dd>

      <dd>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</dd>

      <dd>When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</dd>

      <dd>There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.</dd>

      <dd>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</dd>

      <dd>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."</dd>

      <dd>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</dd>

      <dd>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote32">32</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</dd>

      <dd>Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</dd>

      <dd>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</dd>

      <dt>38</dt>

      <dd>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</dd>

      <dt>39</dt>

      <dd>"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</dd>

      <dt>40</dt>

      <dd>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</dd>

      <dt>41</dt>

      <dd>Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</dd>

      <dt>43</dt>

      <dd>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, <sup>[<a href="#footnote35">35</a>]</sup> but no one could heal her.</dd>

      <dt>44</dt>

      <dd>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</dd>

      <dt>47</dt>

      <dd>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</dd>

      <dt>48</dt>

      <dd>Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</dd>

      <dt>49</dt>

      <dd>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."</dd>

      <dt>50</dt>

      <dd>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</dd>

      <dt>51</dt>

      <dd>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</dd>

      <dt>52</dt>

      <dd>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</dd>

      <dt>53</dt>

      <dd>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</dd>

      <dt>54</dt>

      <dd>But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</dd>

      <dt>55</dt>

      <dd>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</dd>

      <dt>56</dt>

      <dd>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</dd>

      <dd>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</dd>

      <dd>and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</dd>

      <dd>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish - unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</dd>

      <dd>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</dd>

      <dd>One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son <sup>[<a href="#footnote61">61</a>]</sup> or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And they had nothing to say.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, `Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, `Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</dd>

      <dd>Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>nor will people say, `Here it is,' or `There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup> you."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Men will tell you, `There he is!' or `Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>For the Son of Man in his day <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup> will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Remember Lot's wife!</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.</dd>

      <dd>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.</dd>

      <dd>He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</dd>

      <dd>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, `Grant me justice against my adversary.'</dd>

      <dd>"For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, `Even though I don't fear God or care about men,</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</dd>

      <dd>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup> himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men - robbers, evildoers, adulterers - or even like this tax collector.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</dd>

      <dd>But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good - except God alone.</dd>

      <dd>"All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</dd>

      <dd>Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"</dd>

      <dd>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>The second</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>Finally, the woman died too.</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</dd>

      <dt>35</dt>

      <dd>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</dd>

      <dt>36</dt>

      <dd>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</dd>

      <dt>37</dt>

      <dd>But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord `the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote79">79</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</dd>

      <dd>That day Herod and Pilate became friends - before this they had been enemies.</dd>

      <dd>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>Therefore, I will punish him and then release him. <sup>[<a href="#footnote90">90</a>]</sup>"</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</dd>

      <dd>The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."</dd>

      <dd>One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</dd>

      <dd>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</dd>

      <dd>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</dd>

      <dd>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles <sup>[<a href="#footnote94">94</a>]</sup> from Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>but they were kept from recognizing him.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>Did not the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote95">95</a>]</sup> have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</dd>

      <dt>32</dt>

      <dd>They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</dd>

      <dt>33</dt>

      <dd>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</dd>

      <dt>34</dt>

      <dd>and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</dd>

      <dd>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</dd>

      <dd>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</dd>

      <dt>42</dt>

      <dd>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</dd>

      <dt>45</dt>

      <dd>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</dd>

      <dt>46</dt>

      <dd>He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</dd>
