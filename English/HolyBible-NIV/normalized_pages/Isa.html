    <p></p>

    <dl>
      <dd></dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness - only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"The multitude of your sacrifices - what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations - I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her - but now murderers!</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.</dd>

      <dt>29</dt>

      <dd>"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</dd>

      <dt>30</dt>

      <dd>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</dd>

      <dt>31</dt>

      <dd>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."</dd>

      <dd>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.</dd>

      <dd>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</dd>

      <dd>and the idols will totally disappear.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</dd>

      <dd>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>He said, "Go and tell this people: "`Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?" And he answered: "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.</dd>

      <dd>And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."</dd>

      <dd>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Say to him, `Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood - because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it."</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`It will not take place, it will not happen,</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>"Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Therefore the Lord himself will give you <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup> a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> will call him Immanuel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah - he will bring the king of Assyria."</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup> - the king of Assyria - to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>In that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>And because of the abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, <sup>[<a href="#footnote19">19</a>]</sup> there will be only briers and thorns.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest - as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup>; a little here, a little there."</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose" - but they would not listen.</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there - so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured.</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup> we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup> our hiding place."</dd>

      <dt>16</dt>

      <dd>So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.</dd>

      <dt>19</dt>

      <dd>As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.</dd>

      <dt>20</dt>

      <dd>The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon - to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.</dd>

      <dt>23</dt>

      <dd>Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.</dd>

      <dt>24</dt>

      <dd>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?</dd>

      <dt>25</dt>

      <dd>When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> barley in its plot, <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup> and spelt in its field?</dd>

      <dt>26</dt>

      <dd>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.</dd>

      <dt>27</dt>

      <dd>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.</dd>

      <dt>28</dt>

      <dd>Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.</dd>

      <dd>as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I don't know how to read."</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>The Lord says: "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. <sup>[<a href="#footnote75">75</a>]</sup></dd>

      <dd>In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?</dd>

      <dd>Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil: He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>The scoundrel's methods are wicked, he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.</dd>

      <dd>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah, "`This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>You say you have strategy and military strength - but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God" - isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?</dd>

      <dt>8</dt>

      <dd>"`Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses - if you can put riders on them!</dd>

      <dt>9</dt>

      <dd>How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?</dd>

      <dt>10</dt>

      <dd>Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."</dd>

      <dt>12</dt>

      <dd>But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall - who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"</dd>

      <dt>13</dt>

      <dd>Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</dd>

      <dt>14</dt>

      <dd>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!</dd>

      <dt>15</dt>

      <dd>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, `The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'</dd>

      <dd>"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,</dd>

      <dt>17</dt>

      <dd>until I come and take you to a land like your own - a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</dd>

      <dt>18</dt>

      <dd>"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, `The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</dd>

      <dd>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?</dd>

      <dd>Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"</dd>

      <dt>21</dt>

      <dd>But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."</dd>

      <dt>22</dt>

      <dd>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.</dd>

      <dt>11</dt>

      <dd>I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.</dd>

      <dd>Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.</dd>

      <dt>2</dt>

      <dd>But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</dd>

      <dt>3</dt>

      <dd>For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things.</dd>

      <dt>4</dt>

      <dd>No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.</dd>

      <dt>5</dt>

      <dd>They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.</dd>

      <dt>6</dt>

      <dd>Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.</dd>

      <dt>7</dt>

      <dd>Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways.</dd>

      <dd>rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.</dd>
