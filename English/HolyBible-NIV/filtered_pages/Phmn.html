<c>Philemon</c>
<i>1</i><t>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</t>
<i>2</i><t>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:</t>
<i>3</i><t>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</t>
<s>Thanksgiving and Prayer</s>
<i>4</i><t>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</t>
<i>5</i><t>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</t>
<i>6</i><t>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</t>
<i>7</i><t>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</t>
<s>Paul's Plea for Onesimus</s>
<i>8</i><t>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</t>
<i>9</i><t>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul - an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus -</t>
<i>10</i><t>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.</t>
<i>11</i><t>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</t>
<i>12</i><t>I am sending him - who is my very heart - back to you.</t>
<i>13</i><t>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</t>
<i>14</i><t>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</t>
<i>15</i><t>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good -</t>
<i>16</i><t>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</t>
<i>17</i><t>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</t>
<i>18</i><t>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</t>
<i>19</i><t>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back - not to mention that you owe me your very self.</t>
<i>20</i><t>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</t>
<i>21</i><t>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</t>
<i>22</i><t>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</t>
<i>23</i><t>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</t>
<i>24</i><t>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</t>
<i>25</i><t>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</t>
