<book>2 Timothy</book>
<c>2 Timothy 1</c>
<i>1</i><t>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</t>
<i>2</i><t>To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</t>
<s>Encouragement to Be Faithful</s>
<i>3</i><t>I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</t>
<i>4</i><t>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</t>
<i>5</i><t>I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</t>
<i>6</i><t>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</t>
<i>7</i><t>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</t>
<i>8</i><t>So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</t>
<i>9</i><t>who has saved us and called us to a holy life - not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</t>
<i>10</i><t>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</t>
<i>11</i><t>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</t>
<i>12</i><t>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</t>
<i>13</i><t>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</t>
<s>A Workman Approved by God</s>
<i>14</i><t>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you - guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</t>
<i>15</i><t>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</t>
<i>16</i><t>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</t>
<i>17</i><t>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</t>
<i>18</i><t>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</t>
<c>2 Timothy 2</c>
<s>Godlessness in the Last Days</s>
<i>1</i><t>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</t>
<i>2</i><t>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</t>
<i>3</i><t>Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</t>
<i>4</i><t>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs - he wants to please his commanding officer.</t>
<i>5</i><t>Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</t>
<i>6</i><t>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</t>
<i>7</i><t>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</t>
<i>8</i><t>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</t>
<i>9</i><t>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</t>
<s>Paul's Charge to Timothy</s>
<i>10</i><t>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</t>
<i>11</i><t>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</t>
<i>12</i><t>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</t>
<i>13</i><t>if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</t>
<i>14</i><t>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</t>
<i>15</i><t>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</t>
<i>16</i><t>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</t>
<i>17</i><t>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</t>
<i>18</i><t>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</t>
<i>19</i><t>Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</t>
<i>20</i><t>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</t>
<i>21</i><t>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</t>
<i>22</i><t>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</t>
<i>23</i><t>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</t>
<i>24</i><t>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</t>
<i>25</i><t>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</t>
<i>26</i><t>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</t>
<c>2 Timothy 3</c>
<i>1</i><t>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.</t>
<i>2</i><t>People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</t>
<i>3</i><t>without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,</t>
<i>4</i><t>treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God -</t>
<i>5</i><t>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.</t>
<i>6</i><t>They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,</t>
<i>7</i><t>always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.</t>
<i>8</i><t>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth - men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.</t>
<s>Personal Remarks</s>
<i>9</i><t>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</t>
<i>10</i><t>You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</t>
<i>11</i><t>persecutions, sufferings - what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</t>
<i>12</i><t>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</t>
<i>13</i><t>while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</t>
<i>14</i><t>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,</t>
<i>15</i><t>and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</t>
<i>16</i><t>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</t>
<i>17</i><t>so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</t>
<c>2 Timothy 4</c>
<i>1</i><t>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</t>
<i>2</i><t>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage - with great patience and careful instruction.</t>
<i>3</i><t>For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</t>
<i>4</i><t>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</t>
<i>5</i><t>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</t>
<i>6</i><t>For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.</t>
<i>7</i><t>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</t>
<i>8</i><t>Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day - and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</t>
<i>9</i><t>Do your best to come to me quickly,</t>
<i>10</i><t>for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</t>
<i>11</i><t>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.</t>
<i>12</i><t>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</t>
<i>13</i><t>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</t>
<i>14</i><t>Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.</t>
<i>15</i><t>You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.</t>
<i>16</i><t>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.</t>
<i>17</i><t>But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.</t>
<i>18</i><t>The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</t>
<s>Final Greetings</s>
<i>19</i><t>Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</t>
<i>20</i><t>Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.</t>
<i>21</i><t>Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.</t>
<i>22</i><t>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</t>
