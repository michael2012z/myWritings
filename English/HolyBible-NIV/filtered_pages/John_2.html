<c>2 John</c>
<i>1</i><t>The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth - and not I only, but also all who know the truth -</t>
<i>2</i><t>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</t>
<i>3</i><t>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</t>
<i>4</i><t>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</t>
<i>5</i><t>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</t>
<i>6</i><t>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</t>
<i>7</i><t>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</t>
<i>8</i><t>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</t>
<i>9</i><t>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</t>
<i>10</i><t>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</t>
<i>11</i><t>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</t>
<i>12</i><t>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</t>
<i>13</i><t>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</t>
