<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Isaiah 1</H2>
<B><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

<DT><BR><I>A Rebellious Nation</I><P><DD>

<DT>2<DD>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
<DT>3<DD>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." 
<DT>4<DD>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. 
<DT>5<DD>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.
<DT>6<DD>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness&#151;only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. 
<DT>7<DD>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
<DT>8<DD>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.
<DT>9<DD>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. 
<DT>10<DD>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
<DT>11<DD>"The multitude of your sacrifices&#151;what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
<DT>12<DD>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?
<DT>13<DD>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations&#151;I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
<DT>14<DD>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
<DT>15<DD>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;
<DT>16<DD>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,
<DT>17<DD>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. 
<DT>18<DD>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
<DT>19<DD>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;
<DT>20<DD>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword."  For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. 
<DT>21<DD>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her&#151;but now murderers!
<DT>22<DD>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.
<DT>23<DD>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.
<DT>24<DD>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.
<DT>25<DD>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.
<DT>26<DD>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City." 
<DT>27<DD>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.
<DT>28<DD>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. 
<DT>29<DD>"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
<DT>30<DD>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.
<DT>31<DD>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="2"></A><H2>Isaiah 2</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>The Mountain of the LORD</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
<DT>2<DD>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
<DT>3<DD>Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<DT>4<DD>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. 
<DT>5<DD>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD. 

<DT><BR><I>The Day of the LORD</I><P><DD>

<DT>6<DD>You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.
<DT>7<DD>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
<DT>8<DD>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
<DT>9<DD>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled&#151;do not forgive them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> 
<DT>10<DD>Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!
<DT>11<DD>The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. 
<DT>12<DD>The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),
<DT>13<DD>for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,
<DT>14<DD>for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,
<DT>15<DD>for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,
<DT>16<DD>for every trading ship <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> and every stately vessel.
<DT>17<DD>The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
<DT>18<DD>and the idols will totally disappear. 
<DT>19<DD>Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
<DT>20<DD>In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.
<DT>21<DD>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth. 
<DT>22<DD>Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he? 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="3"></A><H2>Isaiah 3</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
<DT>2<DD>the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,
<DT>3<DD>the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter. 
<DT>4<DD>I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.
<DT>5<DD>People will oppress each other&#151;man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable. 
<DT>6<DD>A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"
<DT>7<DD>But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people." 
<DT>8<DD>Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
<DT>9<DD>The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. 
<DT>10<DD>Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
<DT>11<DD>Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done. 
<DT>12<DD>Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path. 
<DT>13<DD>The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.
<DT>14<DD>The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
<DT>15<DD>What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?"  declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. 
<DT>16<DD>The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
<DT>17<DD>Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."
<DT>18<DD>In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,
<DT>19<DD>the earrings and bracelets and veils,
<DT>20<DD>the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,
<DT>21<DD>the signet rings and nose rings,
<DT>22<DD>the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses
<DT>23<DD>and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
<DT>24<DD>Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.
<DT>25<DD>Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.
<DT>26<DD>The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="4"></A><H2>Isaiah 4</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"

<DT><BR><I>The Branch of the LORD</I><P><DD>

<DT>2<DD>In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
<DT>3<DD>Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
<DT>4<DD>The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> of judgment and a spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> of fire.
<DT>5<DD>Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.
<DT>6<DD>It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.

<DT><I>The Song of the Vineyard</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
<DT>2<DD>He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. 
<DT>3<DD>"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
<DT>4<DD>What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?
<DT>5<DD>Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
<DT>6<DD>I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it." 
<DT>7<DD>The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. 

<DT><BR><I>Woes and Judgments</I><P><DD>

<DT>8<DD>Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
<DT>9<DD>The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: "Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.
<DT>10<DD>A ten-acre <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> vineyard will produce only a bath <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> of wine, a homer <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup> of seed only an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup> of grain." 
<DT>11<DD>Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.
<DT>12<DD>They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.
<DT>13<DD>Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst.
<DT>14<DD>Therefore the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup> enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.
<DT>15<DD>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
<DT>16<DD>But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.
<DT>17<DD>Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup> among the ruins of the rich. 
<DT>18<DD>Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,
<DT>19<DD>to those who say, "Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it." 
<DT>20<DD>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. 
<DT>21<DD>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight. 
<DT>22<DD>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,
<DT>23<DD>who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.
<DT>24<DD>Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<DT>25<DD>Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.  Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. 
<DT>26<DD>He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!
<DT>27<DD>Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken.
<DT>28<DD>Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
<DT>29<DD>Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.
<DT>30<DD>In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.

<DT><I>Isaiah's Commission</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.
<DT>2<DD>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
<DT>3<DD>And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."
<DT>4<DD>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
<DT>5<DD>"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."
<DT>6<DD>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
<DT>7<DD>With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."
<DT>8<DD>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
<DT>9<DD>He said, "Go and tell this people: "`Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'
<DT>10<DD>Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
<DT>11<DD>Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?" And he answered: "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,
<DT>12<DD>until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
<DT>13<DD>And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."

<DT><I>The Sign of Immanuel</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
<DT>2<DD>Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
<DT>3<DD>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.
<DT>4<DD>Say to him, `Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood&#151;because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
<DT>5<DD>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,
<DT>6<DD>"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it."
<DT>7<DD>Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`It will not take place, it will not happen,
<DT>8<DD>for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
<DT>9<DD>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"
<DT>10<DD>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,
<DT>11<DD>"Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."
<DT>12<DD>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."
<DT>13<DD>Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?
<DT>14<DD>Therefore the Lord himself will give you <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup> a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup> will call him Immanuel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup>
<DT>15<DD>He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
<DT>16<DD>But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
<DT>17<DD>The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah&#151;he will bring the king of Assyria."
<DT>18<DD>In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
<DT>19<DD>They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.
<DT>20<DD>In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup>&#151;the king of Assyria&#151;to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.
<DT>21<DD>In that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
<DT>22<DD>And because of the abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
<DT>23<DD>In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, <sup>[<a href="#footnote19">19</a>]</sup> there will be only briers and thorns.
<DT>24<DD>Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
<DT>25<DD>As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.

<DT>3<DD>Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
<DT>4<DD>Before the boy knows how to say `My father' or `My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
<DT>5<DD>The LORD spoke to me again:
<DT>6<DD>"Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
<DT>7<DD>therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote21">21</a>]</sup>&#151;the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks

<DT>11<DD>The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:
<DT>12<DD>"Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy <sup>[<a href="#footnote25">25</a>]</sup>; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
<DT>13<DD>The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,
<DT>14<DD>and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
<DT>15<DD>Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured." 
<DT>16<DD>Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.
<DT>17<DD>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.

<DT>8<DD>The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel.
<DT>9<DD>All the people will know it&#151;Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria&#151;who say with pride and arrogance of heart,
<DT>10<DD>"The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars."
<DT>11<DD>But the LORD has strengthened Rezin's foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
<DT>12<DD>Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth.  Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. 
<DT>13<DD>But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the LORD Almighty.
<DT>14<DD>So the LORD will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day;
<DT>15<DD>the elders and prominent men are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
<DT>16<DD>Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray.
<DT>17<DD>Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks vileness.  Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
<DT>18<DD>Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
<DT>19<DD>By the wrath of the LORD Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother.
<DT>20<DD>On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring <sup>[<a href="#footnote28">28</a>]</sup>:

<DT>6<DD>I send him against a godless nation, I dispatch him against a people who anger me, to seize loot and snatch plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
<DT>7<DD>But this is not what he intends, this is not what he has in mind; his purpose is to destroy, to put an end to many nations.
<DT>8<DD>`Are not my commanders all kings?' he says.
<DT>9<DD>`Has not Calno fared like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad, and Samaria like Damascus?
<DT>10<DD>As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols, kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria&#151;
<DT>11<DD>shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images as I dealt with Samaria and her idols?'"
<DT>12<DD>When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, "I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes.
<DT>13<DD>For he says: "`By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued <sup>[<a href="#footnote29">29</a>]</sup> their kings.
<DT>14<DD>As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as men gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.'" 
<DT>15<DD>Does the ax raise itself above him who swings it, or the saw boast against him who uses it? As if a rod were to wield him who lifts it up, or a club brandish him who is not wood!
<DT>16<DD>Therefore, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame.
<DT>17<DD>The Light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers.
<DT>18<DD>The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick man wastes away.

<DT>25<DD>Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction." 
<DT>26<DD>The LORD Almighty will lash them with a whip, as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt.

<DT>1<DD>An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
<DT>2<DD>Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.
<DT>3<DD>I have commanded my holy ones; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath&#151;those who rejoice in my triumph. 
<DT>4<DD>Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war.
<DT>5<DD>They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens&#151;the LORD and the weapons of his wrath&#151;to destroy the whole country. 
<DT>6<DD>Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote38">38</a>]</sup>

<DT>9<DD>See, the day of the LORD is coming&#151;a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger&#151;to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
<DT>10<DD>The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.
<DT>11<DD>I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.
<DT>12<DD>I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir.
<DT>13<DD>Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger. 
<DT>14<DD>Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.
<DT>15<DD>Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword.
<DT>16<DD>Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished.

<DT>19<DD>Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' <sup>[<a href="#footnote39">39</a>]</sup> pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
<DT>20<DD>She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there.
<DT>21<DD>But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about.

<DT>10<DD>They will all respond, they will say to you, "You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us."
<DT>11<DD>All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you. 
<DT>12<DD>How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!

<DT>18<DD>All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
<DT>19<DD>But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
<DT>20<DD>you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people.  The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again.
<DT>21<DD>Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.

<DT>2<DD>Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.
<DT>3<DD>In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping.
<DT>4<DD>Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint. 
<DT>5<DD>My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.
<DT>6<DD>The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.
<DT>7<DD>So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.

<DT>6<DD>We have heard of Moab's pride&#151;her overweening pride and conceit, her pride and her insolence&#151;but her boasts are empty.

<DT>8<DD>The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.
<DT>9<DD>So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon, O Elealeh, I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.

<DT>12<DD>When Moab appears at her high place, she only wears herself out; when she goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no avail.
<DT>13<DD>This is the word the LORD has already spoken concerning Moab.

<DT>3<DD>All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.
<DT>4<DD>This is what the LORD says to me: "I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
<DT>5<DD>For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.
<DT>6<DD>They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.
<DT>7<DD>At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers&#151;the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD Almighty.

<DT>1<DD>An oracle concerning Egypt: See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them. 
<DT>2<DD>"I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian&#151;brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
<DT>3<DD>The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.
<DT>4<DD>I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. 
<DT>5<DD>The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.
<DT>6<DD>The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither,
<DT>7<DD>also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.
<DT>8<DD>The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.
<DT>9<DD>Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.
<DT>10<DD>The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart. 
<DT>11<DD>The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings"?

<DT>14<DD>The LORD has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
<DT>15<DD>There is nothing Egypt can do&#151;head or tail, palm branch or reed.
<DT>16<DD>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them.
<DT>17<DD>And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them.
<DT>18<DD>In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of Destruction. <sup>[<a href="#footnote51">51</a>]</sup>
<DT>19<DD>In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border.
<DT>20<DD>It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.
<DT>21<DD>So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them.
<DT>22<DD>The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
<DT>23<DD>In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
<DT>24<DD>In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.

<DT>3<DD>All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away.
<DT>4<DD>Therefore I said, "Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people." 
<DT>5<DD>The Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.
<DT>6<DD>Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield.
<DT>7<DD>Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates;
<DT>8<DD>the defenses of Judah are stripped away.  And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest;

<DT>10<DD>You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
<DT>11<DD>You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago. 
<DT>12<DD>The Lord, the LORD Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
<DT>13<DD>But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!"
<DT>14<DD>The LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: "Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the LORD Almighty. 
<DT>15<DD>This is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: "Go, say to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace:

<DT>1<DD>An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus <sup>[<a href="#footnote56">56</a>]</sup> word has come to them. 
<DT>2<DD>Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.
<DT>3<DD>On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile <sup>[<a href="#footnote57">57</a>]</sup> was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations. 
<DT>4<DD>Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: "I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters."
<DT>5<DD>When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre. 
<DT>6<DD>Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.

<DT>13<DD>Look at the land of the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote61">61</a>]</sup> this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.

<DT>17<DD>At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.

<DT>7<DD>And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.
<DT>8<DD>All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. 
<DT>9<DD>"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?
<DT>10<DD>For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup>; a little here, a little there." 
<DT>11<DD>Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,
<DT>12<DD>to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose"&#151;but they would not listen.
<DT>13<DD>So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there&#151;so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured. 
<DT>14<DD>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
<DT>15<DD>You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup> we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup> our hiding place."
<DT>16<DD>So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.
<DT>17<DD>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.
<DT>18<DD>Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.
<DT>19<DD>As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through."  The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
<DT>20<DD>The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
<DT>21<DD>The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon&#151;to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.
<DT>22<DD>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. 
<DT>23<DD>Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.
<DT>24<DD>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?
<DT>25<DD>When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> barley in its plot, <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup> and spelt in its field?
<DT>26<DD>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. 
<DT>27<DD>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.
<DT>28<DD>Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.
<DT>29<DD>All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.

<DT><I>Woe to David's City</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on.
<DT>2<DD>Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn and lament, she will be to me like an altar hearth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote74">74</a>]</sup>
<DT>3<DD>I will encamp against you all around; I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you.
<DT>4<DD>Brought low, you will speak from the ground; your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper. 
<DT>5<DD>But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,
<DT>6<DD>the LORD Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.
<DT>7<DD>Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night&#151;
<DT>8<DD>as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion. 
<DT>9<DD>Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer.
<DT>10<DD>The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers).
<DT>11<DD>For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I can't; it is sealed."
<DT>12<DD>Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I don't know how to read." 
<DT>13<DD>The Lord says: "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. <sup>[<a href="#footnote75">75</a>]</sup>
<DT>14<DD>Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish."
<DT>15<DD>Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think, "Who sees us? Who will know?"
<DT>16<DD>You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, "He did not make me"? Can the pot say of the potter, "He knows nothing"? 
<DT>17<DD>In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?
<DT>18<DD>In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
<DT>19<DD>Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
<DT>20<DD>The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down&#151;
<DT>21<DD>those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
<DT>22<DD>Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob: "No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale.
<DT>23<DD>When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
<DT>24<DD>Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction."

<DT><I>Woe to the Obstinate Nation</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>"Woe to the obstinate children," declares the LORD, "to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin;
<DT>2<DD>who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh's protection, to Egypt's shade for refuge.
<DT>3<DD>But Pharaoh's protection will be to your shame, Egypt's shade will bring you disgrace.
<DT>4<DD>Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
<DT>5<DD>everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace."
<DT>6<DD>An oracle concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys' backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation,
<DT>7<DD>to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing. 
<DT>8<DD>Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness.
<DT>9<DD>These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD's instruction.
<DT>10<DD>They say to the seers, "See no more visions!" and to the prophets, "Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.
<DT>11<DD>Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!"
<DT>12<DD>Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: "Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit,
<DT>13<DD>this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant.
<DT>14<DD>It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern."
<DT>15<DD>This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: "In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it.
<DT>16<DD>You said, `No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, `We will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore your pursuers will be swift!
<DT>17<DD>A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill." 
<DT>18<DD>Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him!
<DT>19<DD>O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you.
<DT>20<DD>Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them.
<DT>21<DD>Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."
<DT>22<DD>Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Away with you!" 
<DT>23<DD>He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows.
<DT>24<DD>The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel.
<DT>25<DD>In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill.
<DT>26<DD>The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.
<DT>27<DD>See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire.
<DT>28<DD>His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray.
<DT>29<DD>And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
<DT>30<DD>The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.
<DT>31<DD>The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down.
<DT>32<DD>Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.
<DT>33<DD>Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.

<DT>1<DD>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the LORD.
<DT>2<DD>Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster; he does not take back his words. He will rise up against the house of the wicked, against those who help evildoers.
<DT>3<DD>But the Egyptians are men and not God; their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the LORD stretches out his hand, he who helps will stumble, he who is helped will fall; both will perish together.
<DT>4<DD>This is what the LORD says to me: "As a lion growls, a great lion over his prey&#151;and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against him, he is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor&#151;so the LORD Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.
<DT>5<DD>Like birds hovering overhead, the LORD Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it, he will `pass over' it and will rescue it."
<DT>6<DD>Return to him you have so greatly revolted against, O Israelites.
<DT>7<DD>For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.
<DT>8<DD>"Assyria will fall by a sword that is not of man; a sword, not of mortals, will devour them. They will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor.
<DT>9<DD>Their stronghold will fall because of terror; at sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic," declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is in Jerusalem.

<DT>4<DD>The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
<DT>5<DD>No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
<DT>6<DD>For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil: He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.

<DT><I>Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
<DT>2<DD>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,
<DT>3<DD>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
<DT>4<DD>The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah,  "`This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
<DT>5<DD>You say you have strategy and military strength&#151;but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?
<DT>6<DD>Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
<DT>7<DD>And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"&#151;isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?
<DT>8<DD>"`Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses&#151;if you can put riders on them!
<DT>9<DD>How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
<DT>10<DD>Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'" 
<DT>11<DD>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
<DT>12<DD>But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall&#151;who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"
<DT>13<DD>Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
<DT>14<DD>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
<DT>15<DD>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, `The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
<DT>16<DD>"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
<DT>17<DD>until I come and take you to a land like your own&#151;a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
<DT>18<DD>"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, `The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
<DT>19<DD>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
<DT>20<DD>Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
<DT>21<DD>But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."
<DT>22<DD>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.

<DT><I>Jerusalem's Deliverance Foretold</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.
<DT>2<DD>He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
<DT>3<DD>They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
<DT>4<DD>It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."
<DT>5<DD>When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,
<DT>6<DD>Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, `This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard&#151;those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
<DT>7<DD>Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"
<DT>8<DD>When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
<DT>9<DD>Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite <sup>[<a href="#footnote84">84</a>]</sup> king [of Egypt], was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:
<DT>10<DD>"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, `Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
<DT>11<DD>Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
<DT>12<DD>Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them&#151;the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
<DT>13<DD>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"

<DT><BR><I>Hezekiah's Prayer</I><P><DD>

<DT>14<DD>Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
<DT>15<DD>And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
<DT>16<DD>"O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
<DT>17<DD>Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
<DT>18<DD>"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.
<DT>19<DD>They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
<DT>20<DD>Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote85">85</a>]</sup>"

<DT><BR><I>Sennacherib's Fall</I><P><DD>

<DT>21<DD>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
<DT>22<DD>this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: "The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
<DT>23<DD>Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
<DT>24<DD>By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, `With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.
<DT>25<DD>I have dug wells in foreign lands <sup>[<a href="#footnote86">86</a>]</sup> and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.' 
<DT>26<DD>"Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
<DT>27<DD>Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched <sup>[<a href="#footnote87">87</a>]</sup> before it grows up. 
<DT>28<DD>"But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
<DT>29<DD>Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.
<DT>30<DD>"This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
<DT>31<DD>Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
<DT>32<DD>For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
<DT>33<DD>"Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
<DT>34<DD>By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city,"  declares the LORD.
<DT>35<DD>"I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!"
<DT>36<DD>Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning&#151;there were all the dead bodies!
<DT>37<DD>So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
<DT>38<DD>One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.

<DT><I>Hezekiah's Illness</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
<DT>2<DD>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
<DT>3<DD>"Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
<DT>4<DD>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
<DT>5<DD>"Go and tell Hezekiah, `This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.
<DT>6<DD>And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
<DT>7<DD>"`This is the LORD's sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised:
<DT>8<DD>I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.'" So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down. 
<DT>9<DD>A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
<DT>10<DD>I said, "In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup> and be robbed of the rest of my years?"
<DT>11<DD>I said, "I will not again see the LORD, the LORD, in the land of the living; no longer will I look on mankind, or be with those who now dwell in this world. <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup>
<DT>12<DD>Like a shepherd's tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me.
<DT>13<DD>I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me.
<DT>14<DD>I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am troubled; O Lord, come to my aid!" 
<DT>15<DD>But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul.
<DT>16<DD>Lord, by such things men live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live.
<DT>17<DD>Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.
<DT>18<DD>For the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote90">90</a>]</sup> cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
<DT>19<DD>The living, the living&#151;they praise you, as I am doing today; fathers tell their children about your faithfulness. 
<DT>20<DD>The LORD will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the LORD.
<DT>21<DD>Isaiah had said, "Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover."
<DT>22<DD>Hezekiah had asked, "What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the LORD?"

<DT><I>Envoys From Babylon</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery.
<DT>2<DD>Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses&#151;the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
<DT>3<DD>Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came to me from Babylon."
<DT>4<DD>The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?" "They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
<DT>5<DD>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD Almighty:
<DT>6<DD>The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
<DT>7<DD>And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
<DT>8<DD>"The word of the LORD you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my lifetime."

<DT>2<DD>Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins. 
<DT>3<DD>A voice of one calling: "In the desert prepare the way for the LORD <sup>[<a href="#footnote91">91</a>]</sup>; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote92">92</a>]</sup>
<DT>4<DD>Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.
<DT>5<DD>And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it.  For the mouth of the LORD has spoken." 
<DT>6<DD>A voice says, "Cry out." And I said, "What shall I cry?"  "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
<DT>7<DD>The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass.
<DT>8<DD>The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever." 
<DT>9<DD>You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, <sup>[<a href="#footnote93">93</a>]</sup> lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, "Here is your God!"
<DT>10<DD>See, the Sovereign LORD comes with power, and his arm rules for him. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.
<DT>11<DD>He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young. 
<DT>12<DD>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?
<DT>13<DD>Who has understood the mind <sup>[<a href="#footnote94">94</a>]</sup> of the LORD, or instructed him as his counselor?
<DT>14<DD>Whom did the LORD consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding? 
<DT>15<DD>Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
<DT>16<DD>Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
<DT>17<DD>Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing. 
<DT>18<DD>To whom, then, will you compare God? What image will you compare him to?
<DT>19<DD>As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
<DT>20<DD>A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple. 
<DT>21<DD>Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
<DT>22<DD>He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
<DT>23<DD>He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
<DT>24<DD>No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. 
<DT>25<DD>"To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?" says the Holy One.
<DT>26<DD>Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. 
<DT>27<DD>Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God"?
<DT>28<DD>Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
<DT>29<DD>He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
<DT>30<DD>Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;

<DT>3<DD>He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before.
<DT>4<DD>Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD&#151;with the first of them and with the last&#151;I am he." 
<DT>5<DD>The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward;
<DT>6<DD>each helps the other and says to his brother, "Be strong!"
<DT>7<DD>The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil. He says of the welding, "It is good." He nails down the idol so it will not topple. 
<DT>8<DD>"But you, O Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend,

<DT>17<DD>"The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the LORD will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
<DT>18<DD>I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs.
<DT>19<DD>I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set pines in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together,
<DT>20<DD>so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it. 
<DT>21<DD>"Present your case," says the LORD. "Set forth your arguments," says Jacob's King.

<DT>16<DD>This is what the LORD says&#151;he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,
<DT>17<DD>who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
<DT>18<DD>"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
<DT>19<DD>See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
<DT>20<DD>The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
<DT>21<DD>the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise. 
<DT>22<DD>"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel.
<DT>23<DD>You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
<DT>24<DD>You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses. 
<DT>25<DD>"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.
<DT>26<DD>Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence.
<DT>27<DD>Your first father sinned; your spokesmen rebelled against me.
<DT>28<DD>So I will disgrace the dignitaries of your temple, and I will consign Jacob to destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote98">98</a>]</sup> and Israel to scorn.

<DT>2<DD>This is what the LORD says&#151;he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
<DT>3<DD>For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.
<DT>4<DD>They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.

<DT>12<DD>The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.
<DT>13<DD>The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in the form of man, of man in all his glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.
<DT>14<DD>He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
<DT>15<DD>It is man's fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
<DT>16<DD>Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see the fire."
<DT>17<DD>From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me; you are my god."
<DT>18<DD>They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
<DT>19<DD>No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"
<DT>20<DD>He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?" 
<DT>21<DD>"Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel. I have made you, you are my servant; O Israel, I will not forget you.
<DT>22<DD>I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you."

<DT>12<DD>It is I who made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshaled their starry hosts.
<DT>13<DD>I will raise up Cyrus <sup>[<a href="#footnote100">100</a>]</sup> in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says the LORD Almighty."

They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, `Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.'" 
<DT>15<DD>Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God and Savior of Israel.
<DT>16<DD>All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off into disgrace together.
<DT>17<DD>But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting. 
<DT>18<DD>For this is what the LORD says&#151;he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited&#151;he says: "I am the LORD, and there is no other.
<DT>19<DD>I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob's descendants, `Seek me in vain.' I, the LORD, speak the truth; I declare what is right.

<DT>22<DD>This is what your Sovereign LORD says, your God, who defends his people: "See, I have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger; from that cup, the goblet of my wrath, you will never drink again.

<DT>3<DD>He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 
<DT>4<DD>Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.
<DT>5<DD>But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.
<DT>6<DD>We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 
<DT>7<DD>He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
<DT>8<DD>By oppression <sup>[<a href="#footnote112">112</a>]</sup> and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. <sup>[<a href="#footnote113">113</a>]</sup>
<DT>9<DD>He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. 
<DT>10<DD>Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes <sup>[<a href="#footnote114">114</a>]</sup> his  life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.
<DT>11<DD>After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light [of life] <sup>[<a href="#footnote115">115</a>]</sup> and be satisfied <sup>[<a href="#footnote116">116</a>]</sup>; by his knowledge <sup>[<a href="#footnote117">117</a>]</sup> my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.

<DT>4<DD>"Do not be afraid; you will not suffer shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
<DT>5<DD>For your Maker is your husband&#151;the LORD Almighty is his name&#151;the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth.

<DT>7<DD>"For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
<DT>8<DD>In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you," says the LORD your Redeemer.

<DT><I>Sin, Confession and Redemption</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.
<DT>2<DD>But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.
<DT>3<DD>For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things.
<DT>4<DD>No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
<DT>5<DD>They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.
<DT>6<DD>Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.
<DT>7<DD>Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways.
<DT>8<DD>The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace. 
<DT>9<DD>So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.
<DT>10<DD>Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like men without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead.
<DT>11<DD>We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. 
<DT>12<DD>For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities:
<DT>13<DD>rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
<DT>14<DD>So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.
<DT>15<DD>Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.  The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
<DT>16<DD>He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.
<DT>17<DD>He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
<DT>18<DD>According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due.
<DT>19<DD>From the west, men will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along. <sup>[<a href="#footnote126">126</a>]</sup>

<DT><I>The Year of the LORD'S Favor</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, <sup>[<a href="#footnote128">128</a>]</sup>
<DT>2<DD>to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,
<DT>3<DD>and provide for those who grieve in Zion&#151;to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor. 
<DT>4<DD>They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
<DT>5<DD>Aliens will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
<DT>6<DD>And you will be called priests of the LORD, you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast. 
<DT>7<DD>Instead of their shame my people will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance; and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs. 
<DT>8<DD>"For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.
<DT>9<DD>Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the LORD has blessed." 
<DT>10<DD>I delight greatly in the LORD; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
<DT>11<DD>For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign LORD will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.

<DT><I>Zion's New Name</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her righteousness shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.
<DT>2<DD>The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.
<DT>3<DD>You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD's hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
<DT>4<DD>No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote129">129</a>]</sup> and your land Beulah <sup>[<a href="#footnote130">130</a>]</sup>; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be married.
<DT>5<DD>As a young man marries a maiden, so will your sons <sup>[<a href="#footnote131">131</a>]</sup> marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you. 
<DT>6<DD>I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest,
<DT>7<DD>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth. 
<DT>8<DD>The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled;
<DT>9<DD>but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary." 
<DT>10<DD>Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations. 
<DT>11<DD>The LORD has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: "Say to the Daughter of Zion, `See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'"
<DT>12<DD>They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.

<DT><I>God's Day of Vengeance and Redemption</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength?  "It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save." 
<DT>2<DD>Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 
<DT>3<DD>"I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.
<DT>4<DD>For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come.
<DT>5<DD>I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.
<DT>6<DD>I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground." 

<DT><BR><I>Praise and Prayer</I><P><DD>

<DT>7<DD>I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the LORD has done for us&#151;yes, the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses.
<DT>8<DD>He said, "Surely they are my people, sons who will not be false to me"; and so he became their Savior.
<DT>9<DD>In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
<DT>10<DD>Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. 
<DT>11<DD>Then his people recalled <sup>[<a href="#footnote132">132</a>]</sup> the days of old, the days of Moses and his people&#151;where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them,
<DT>12<DD>who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses' right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown,
<DT>13<DD>who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;
<DT>14<DD>like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name. 
<DT>15<DD>Look down from heaven and see from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.
<DT>16<DD>But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
<DT>17<DD>Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.
<DT>18<DD>For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.
<DT>19<DD>We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name. <sup>[<a href="#footnote133">133</a>]</sup> 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="64"></A><H2>Isaiah 64</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you!
<DT>2<DD>As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you!
<DT>3<DD>For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
<DT>4<DD>Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
<DT>5<DD>You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?
<DT>6<DD>All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.
<DT>7<DD>No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins. 
<DT>8<DD>Yet, O LORD, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.
<DT>9<DD>Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look upon us, we pray, for we are all your people.
<DT>10<DD>Your sacred cities have become a desert; even Zion is a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.
<DT>11<DD>Our holy and glorious temple, where our fathers praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
<DT>12<DD>After all this, O LORD, will you hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure? 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="65"></A><H2>Isaiah 65</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Judgment and Salvation</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>"I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, `Here am I, here am I.'
<DT>2<DD>All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations&#151;
<DT>3<DD>a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick;
<DT>4<DD>who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat;
<DT>5<DD>who say, `Keep away; don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you!' Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day. 
<DT>6<DD>"See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps&#151;
<DT>7<DD>both your sins and the sins of your fathers," says the LORD. "Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds."
<DT>8<DD>This is what the LORD says: "As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, `Don't destroy it, there is yet some good in it,' so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.
<DT>9<DD>I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live.
<DT>10<DD>Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me. 
<DT>11<DD>"But as for you who forsake the LORD and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
<DT>12<DD>I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bend down for the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me."
<DT>13<DD>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
<DT>14<DD>My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
<DT>15<DD>You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.
<DT>16<DD>Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes. 

<DT><BR><I>New Heavens and a New Earth</I><P><DD>

<DT>17<DD>"Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
<DT>18<DD>But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
<DT>19<DD>I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more. 
<DT>20<DD>"Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth; he who fails to reach <sup>[<a href="#footnote134">134</a>]</sup> a hundred will be considered accursed.
<DT>21<DD>They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
<DT>22<DD>No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.
<DT>23<DD>They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them.
<DT>24<DD>Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
<DT>25<DD>The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="66"></A><H2>Isaiah 66</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Judgment and Hope</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>This is what the LORD says: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?
<DT>2<DD>Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?" declares the LORD.  "This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word.
<DT>3<DD>But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man, and whoever offers a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig's blood, and whoever burns memorial incense, like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations;
<DT>4<DD>so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me." 
<DT>5<DD>Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, `Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame.
<DT>6<DD>Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve. 
<DT>7<DD>"Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.
<DT>8<DD>Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
<DT>9<DD>Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?" says your God.
<DT>10<DD>"Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.
<DT>11<DD>For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance."
<DT>12<DD>For this is what the LORD says: "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
<DT>13<DD>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem." 
<DT>14<DD>When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
<DT>15<DD>See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<DT>16<DD>For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment upon all men, and many will be those slain by the LORD.
<DT>17<DD>"Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of <sup>[<a href="#footnote135">135</a>]</sup> those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things&#151;they will meet their end together," declares the LORD.
<DT>18<DD>"And I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come <sup>[<a href="#footnote136">136</a>]</sup> and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.
<DT>19<DD>"I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations&#151;to Tarshish, to the Libyans <sup>[<a href="#footnote137">137</a>]</sup> and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
<DT>20<DD>And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD&#151;on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels," says the LORD. "They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels.
<DT>21<DD>And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites," says the LORD. 
<DT>22<DD>"As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your name and descendants endure.
<DT>23<DD>From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the LORD.
<DT>24<DD>"And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."</B>
