<DT>1<DD>The LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting. He said,<DT>2<DD>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.
<DT>3<DD>"`If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to offer a male without defect. He must present it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting so that it <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> will be acceptable to the LORD.
<DT>4<DD>He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
<DT>5<DD>He is to slaughter the young bull before the LORD, and then Aaron's sons the priests shall bring the blood and sprinkle it against the altar on all sides at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>6<DD>He is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
<DT>7<DD>The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
<DT>8<DD>Then Aaron's sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood that is on the altar.
<DT>9<DD>He is to wash the inner parts and the legs with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
<DT>10<DD>"`If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the sheep or the goats, he is to offer a male without defect.
<DT>11<DD>He is to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood against the altar on all sides.
<DT>12<DD>He is to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood that is on the altar.
<DT>13<DD>He is to wash the inner parts and the legs with water, and the priest is to bring all of it and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
<DT>14<DD>"`If the offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, he is to offer a dove or a young pigeon.
<DT>15<DD>The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
<DT>16<DD>He is to remove the crop with its contents <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> and throw it to the east side of the altar, where the ashes are.
<DT>17<DD>He shall tear it open by the wings, not severing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is on the fire on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.

<DT>1<DD>"`When someone brings a grain offering to the LORD, his offering is to be of fine flour. He is to pour oil on it, put incense on it
<DT>2<DD>and take it to Aaron's sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the fine flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
<DT>3<DD>The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made to the LORD by fire.
<DT>4<DD>"`If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of fine flour: cakes made without yeast and mixed with oil, or <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> wafers made without yeast and spread with oil.
<DT>5<DD>If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it is to be made of fine flour mixed with oil, and without yeast.
<DT>6<DD>Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
<DT>7<DD>If your grain offering is cooked in a pan, it is to be made of fine flour and oil.
<DT>8<DD>Bring the grain offering made of these things to the LORD; present it to the priest, who shall take it to the altar.
<DT>9<DD>He shall take out the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
<DT>10<DD>The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made to the LORD by fire.
<DT>11<DD>"`Every grain offering you bring to the LORD must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in an offering made to the LORD by fire.
<DT>12<DD>You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of the firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
<DT>13<DD>Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.
<DT>14<DD>"`If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire.
<DT>15<DD>Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain offering.
<DT>16<DD>The priest shall burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all the incense, as an offering made to the LORD by fire.

<DT><I>The Sin Offering</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Moses,
<DT>2<DD>"Say to the Israelites: `When anyone sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD's commands&#151;
<DT>3<DD>"`If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
<DT>4<DD>He is to present the bull at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD. He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the LORD.
<DT>5<DD>Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>6<DD>He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.
<DT>7<DD>The priest shall then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. The rest of the bull's blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>8<DD>He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering&#151;the fat that covers the inner parts or is connected to them,
<DT>9<DD>both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the covering of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys&#151;

<DT>11<DD>But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, as well as the head and legs, the inner parts and offal&#151;
<DT>12<DD>that is, all the rest of the bull&#151;he must take outside the camp to a place ceremonially clean, where the ashes are thrown, and burn it in a wood fire on the ash heap. 
<DT>13<DD>"`If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD's commands, even though the community is unaware of the matter, they are guilty.
<DT>14<DD>When they become aware of the sin they committed, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>15<DD>The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull's head before the LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD.

<DT>24<DD>He is to lay his hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.

<DT>29<DD>He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
<DT>30<DD>Then the priest is to take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
<DT>31<DD>He shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.

<DT>35<DD>He shall remove all the fat, just as the fat is removed from the lamb of the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made to the LORD by fire.

<DT>10<DD>The priest shall then offer the other as a burnt offering in the prescribed way and make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
<DT>11<DD>"`If, however, he cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, he is to bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> of fine flour for a sin offering. He must not put oil or incense on it, because it is a sin offering.
<DT>12<DD>He is to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made to the LORD by fire. It is a sin offering.

<DT>16<DD>He must make restitution for what he has failed to do in regard to the holy things, add a fifth of the value to that and give it all to the priest, who will make atonement for him with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.

<DT>37<DD>These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,
<DT>38<DD>which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the Desert of Sinai.

<DT><I>The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Moses,
<DT>2<DD>"Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast,
<DT>3<DD>and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."
<DT>4<DD>Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>5<DD>Moses said to the assembly, "This is what the LORD has commanded to be done."
<DT>6<DD>Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
<DT>7<DD>He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also tied the ephod to him by its skillfully woven waistband; so it was fastened on him.
<DT>8<DD>He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
<DT>9<DD>Then he placed the turban on Aaron's head and set the gold plate, the sacred diadem, on the front of it, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT>10<DD>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.
<DT>11<DD>He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
<DT>12<DD>He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
<DT>13<DD>Then he brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and put headbands on them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT>14<DD>He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
<DT>15<DD>Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it.
<DT>16<DD>Moses also took all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar.
<DT>17<DD>But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its offal he burned up outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT>18<DD>He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
<DT>19<DD>Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood against the altar on all sides.
<DT>20<DD>He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat.
<DT>21<DD>He washed the inner parts and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT>22<DD>He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
<DT>23<DD>Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
<DT>24<DD>Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled blood against the altar on all sides.
<DT>25<DD>He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
<DT>26<DD>Then from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the LORD, he took a cake of bread, and one made with oil, and a wafer; he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
<DT>27<DD>He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering.
<DT>28<DD>Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire.
<DT>29<DD>He also took the breast&#151;Moses' share of the ordination ram&#151;and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT>30<DD>Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
<DT>31<DD>Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup> `Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'
<DT>32<DD>Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
<DT>33<DD>Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.
<DT>34<DD>What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you.
<DT>35<DD>You must stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and do what the LORD requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded."
<DT>36<DD>So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded through Moses.

<DT><I>The Priests Begin Their Ministry</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
<DT>2<DD>He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the LORD.
<DT>3<DD>Then say to the Israelites: `Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb&#151;both a year old and without defect&#151;for a burnt offering,
<DT>4<DD>and an ox <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup> and a ram for a fellowship offering <sup>[<a href="#footnote19">19</a>]</sup> to sacrifice before the LORD, together with a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'"
<DT>5<DD>They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the LORD.
<DT>6<DD>Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
<DT>7<DD>Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded."
<DT>8<DD>So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
<DT>9<DD>His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
<DT>10<DD>On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD commanded Moses;
<DT>11<DD>the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
<DT>12<DD>Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
<DT>13<DD>They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
<DT>14<DD>He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
<DT>15<DD>Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people's sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
<DT>16<DD>He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.
<DT>17<DD>He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.
<DT>18<DD>He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
<DT>19<DD>But the fat portions of the ox and the ram&#151;the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver&#151;
<DT>20<DD>these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
<DT>21<DD>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the LORD as a wave offering, as Moses commanded.
<DT>22<DD>Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.
<DT>23<DD>Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
<DT>24<DD>Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.

<DT><I>The Death of Nadab and Abihu</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command.
<DT>2<DD>So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
<DT>3<DD>Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke of when he said: "`Among those who approach me I will show myself holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'" Aaron remained silent.
<DT>4<DD>Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary."
<DT>5<DD>So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.
<DT>6<DD>Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair become unkempt, <sup>[<a href="#footnote20">20</a>]</sup> and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the house of Israel, may mourn for those the LORD has destroyed by fire.
<DT>7<DD>Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting or you will die, because the LORD's anointing oil is on you." So they did as Moses said.
<DT>8<DD>Then the LORD said to Aaron,
<DT>9<DD>"You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
<DT>10<DD>You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean,
<DT>11<DD>and you must teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given them through Moses."
<DT>12<DD>Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left over from the offerings made to the LORD by fire and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, for it is most holy.
<DT>13<DD>Eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons' share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire; for so I have been commanded.
<DT>14<DD>But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites' fellowship offerings. <sup>[<a href="#footnote21">21</a>]</sup>
<DT>15<DD>The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to be waved before the LORD as a wave offering. This will be the regular share for you and your children, as the LORD has commanded."
<DT>16<DD>When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked,
<DT>17<DD>"Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD.
<DT>18<DD>Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded."
<DT>19<DD>Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the LORD have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?"
<DT>20<DD>When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.

<DT>3<DD>The priest is to examine the sore on his skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, <sup>[<a href="#footnote26">26</a>]</sup> it is an infectious skin disease.

<DT>4<DD>If the spot on his skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to put the infected person in isolation for seven days.
<DT>5<DD>On the seventh day the priest is to examine him, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to keep him in isolation another seven days.
<DT>6<DD>On the seventh day the priest is to examine him again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a rash. The man must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.

<DT>8<DD>The priest is to examine him, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infectious disease.
<DT>9<DD>"When anyone has an infectious skin disease, he must be brought to the priest.
<DT>10<DD>The priest is to examine him, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in the swelling,
<DT>11<DD>it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He is not to put him in isolation, because he is already unclean.

<DT>33<DD>he must be shaved except for the diseased area, and the priest is to keep him in isolation another seven days.
<DT>34<DD>On the seventh day the priest is to examine the itch, and if it has not spread in the skin and appears to be no more than skin deep, the priest shall pronounce him clean. He must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.
<DT>35<DD>But if the itch does spread in the skin after he is pronounced clean,
<DT>36<DD>the priest is to examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; the person is unclean.
<DT>37<DD>If, however, in his judgment it is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<DT>38<DD>"When a man or woman has white spots on the skin,
<DT>39<DD>the priest is to examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; that person is clean.

<DT>41<DD>If he has lost his hair from the front of his scalp and has a bald forehead, he is clean.

<DT><I>Cleansing From Infectious Skin Diseases</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Moses,
<DT>2<DD>"These are the regulations for the diseased person at the time of his ceremonial cleansing, when he is brought to the priest:
<DT>3<DD>The priest is to go outside the camp and examine him. If the person has been healed of his infectious skin disease, <sup>[<a href="#footnote28">28</a>]</sup>
<DT>4<DD>the priest shall order that two live clean birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed.
<DT>5<DD>Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.
<DT>6<DD>He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
<DT>7<DD>Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the infectious disease and pronounce him clean. Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields.
<DT>8<DD>"The person to be cleansed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair and bathe with water; then he will be ceremonially clean. After this he may come into the camp, but he must stay outside his tent for seven days.
<DT>9<DD>On the seventh day he must shave off all his hair; he must shave his head, his beard, his eyebrows and the rest of his hair. He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and he will be clean.
<DT>10<DD>"On the eighth day he must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb a year old, each without defect, along with three-tenths of an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote29">29</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log <sup>[<a href="#footnote30">30</a>]</sup> of oil.
<DT>11<DD>The priest who pronounces him clean shall present both the one to be cleansed and his offerings before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>12<DD>"Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
<DT>13<DD>He is to slaughter the lamb in the holy place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
<DT>14<DD>The priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
<DT>15<DD>The priest shall then take some of the log of oil, pour it in the palm of his own left hand,
<DT>16<DD>dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of it before the LORD seven times.
<DT>17<DD>The priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
<DT>18<DD>The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for him before the LORD.
<DT>19<DD>"Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering
<DT>20<DD>and offer it on the altar, together with the grain offering, and make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
<DT>21<DD>"If, however, he is poor and cannot afford these, he must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for him, together with a tenth of an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote31">31</a>]</sup> of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, a log of oil,
<DT>22<DD>and two doves or two young pigeons, which he can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

<DT>24<DD>The priest is to take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
<DT>25<DD>He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
<DT>26<DD>The priest is to pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,
<DT>27<DD>and with his right forefinger sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the LORD.
<DT>28<DD>Some of the oil in his palm he is to put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering&#151;on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
<DT>29<DD>The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.
<DT>30<DD>Then he shall sacrifice the doves or the young pigeons, which the person can afford,
<DT>31<DD>one <sup>[<a href="#footnote32">32</a>]</sup> as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed."

<DT>35<DD>the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, `I have seen something that looks like mildew in my house.'
<DT>36<DD>The priest is to order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mildew, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this the priest is to go in and inspect the house.
<DT>37<DD>He is to examine the mildew on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear to be deeper than the surface of the wall,
<DT>38<DD>the priest shall go out the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.
<DT>39<DD>On the seventh day the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls,
<DT>40<DD>he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.
<DT>41<DD>He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.
<DT>42<DD>Then they are to take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.
<DT>43<DD>"If the mildew reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,
<DT>44<DD>the priest is to go and examine it and, if the mildew has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew; the house is unclean.
<DT>45<DD>It must be torn down&#151;its stones, timbers and all the plaster&#151;and taken out of the town to an unclean place.
<DT>46<DD>"Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean till evening.
<DT>47<DD>Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash his clothes.
<DT>48<DD>"But if the priest comes to examine it and the mildew has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the mildew is gone.
<DT>49<DD>To purify the house he is to take two birds and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn and hyssop.
<DT>50<DD>He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
<DT>51<DD>Then he is to take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
<DT>52<DD>He shall purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet yarn.
<DT>53<DD>Then he is to release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean."
<DT>54<DD>These are the regulations for any infectious skin disease, for an itch,

<DT>1<DD>The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the LORD.
<DT>2<DD>The LORD said to Moses: "Tell your brother Aaron not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark, or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.
<DT>3<DD>"This is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary area: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
<DT>4<DD>He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.
<DT>5<DD>From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
<DT>6<DD>"Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
<DT>7<DD>Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<DT>8<DD>He is to cast lots for the two goats&#151;one lot for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat. <sup>[<a href="#footnote34">34</a>]</sup>
<DT>9<DD>Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the LORD and sacrifice it for a sin offering.
<DT>10<DD>But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to be used for making atonement by sending it into the desert as a scapegoat.
<DT>11<DD>"Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
<DT>12<DD>He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
<DT>13<DD>He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so that he will not die.
<DT>14<DD>He is to take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
<DT>15<DD>"He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
<DT>16<DD>In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
<DT>17<DD>No one is to be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.
<DT>18<DD>"Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
<DT>19<DD>He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
<DT>20<DD>"When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat.
<DT>21<DD>He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites&#151;all their sins&#151;and put them on the goat's head. He shall send the goat away into the desert in the care of a man appointed for the task.
<DT>22<DD>The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a solitary place; and the man shall release it in the desert.
<DT>23<DD>"Then Aaron is to go into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and he is to leave them there.
<DT>24<DD>He shall bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.
<DT>25<DD>He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
<DT>26<DD>"The man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
<DT>27<DD>The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh and offal are to be burned up.
<DT>28<DD>The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may come into the camp.
<DT>29<DD>"This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves <sup>[<a href="#footnote35">35</a>]</sup> and not do any work&#151;whether native-born or an alien living among you&#151;
<DT>30<DD>because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the LORD, you will be clean from all your sins.
<DT>31<DD>It is a sabbath of rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.
<DT>32<DD>The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments
<DT>33<DD>and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the people of the community.
<DT>34<DD>"This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites." And it was done, as the LORD commanded Moses.

<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: `A priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean for any of his people who die,
<DT>2<DD>except for a close relative, such as his mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother,
<DT>3<DD>or an unmarried sister who is dependent on him since she has no husband&#151;for her he may make himself unclean.
<DT>4<DD>He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage, <sup>[<a href="#footnote48">48</a>]</sup> and so defile himself.
<DT>5<DD>"`Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.
<DT>6<DD>They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the offerings made to the LORD by fire, the food of their God, they are to be holy.
<DT>7<DD>"`They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God.
<DT>8<DD>Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the LORD am holy&#151;I who make you holy. <sup>[<a href="#footnote49">49</a>]</sup>
<DT>9<DD>"`If a priest's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.
<DT>10<DD>"`The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt <sup>[<a href="#footnote50">50</a>]</sup> or tear his clothes.
<DT>11<DD>He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother,
<DT>12<DD>nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the LORD.
<DT>13<DD>"`The woman he marries must be a virgin.
<DT>14<DD>He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from his own people,
<DT>15<DD>so he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the LORD, who makes him holy. <sup>[<a href="#footnote51">51</a>]</sup>'"
<DT>16<DD>The LORD said to Moses,
<DT>17<DD>"Say to Aaron: `For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God.
<DT>18<DD>No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed;
<DT>19<DD>no man with a crippled foot or hand,
<DT>20<DD>or who is hunchbacked or dwarfed, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles.
<DT>21<DD>No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the offerings made to the LORD by fire. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.
<DT>22<DD>He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food;

<DT>4<DD>"`If a descendant of Aaron has an infectious skin disease <sup>[<a href="#footnote53">53</a>]</sup> or a bodily discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen,
<DT>5<DD>or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be.
<DT>6<DD>The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
<DT>7<DD>When the sun goes down, he will be clean, and after that he may eat the sacred offerings, for they are his food.
<DT>8<DD>He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, and so become unclean through it. I am the LORD.
<DT>9<DD>"`The priests are to keep my requirements so that they do not become guilty and die for treating them with contempt. I am the LORD, who makes them holy. <sup>[<a href="#footnote54">54</a>]</sup>
<DT>10<DD>"`No one outside a priest's family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it.
<DT>11<DD>But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if a slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food.
<DT>12<DD>If a priest's daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred contributions.
<DT>13<DD>But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no children, and she returns to live in her father's house as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat any of it.
<DT>14<DD>"`If anyone eats a sacred offering by mistake, he must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.
<DT>15<DD>The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the LORD

<DT>15<DD>You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And he is to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.
<DT>16<DD>When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what he is really selling you is the number of crops.
<DT>17<DD>Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your God.
<DT>18<DD>"`Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.
<DT>19<DD>Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
<DT>20<DD>You may ask, "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?"
<DT>21<DD>I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
<DT>22<DD>While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
<DT>23<DD>"`The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants.
<DT>24<DD>Throughout the country that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
<DT>25<DD>"`If one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells some of his property, his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his countryman has sold.
<DT>26<DD>If, however, a man has no one to redeem it for him but he himself prospers and acquires sufficient means to redeem it,
<DT>27<DD>he is to determine the value for the years since he sold it and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it; he can then go back to his own property.
<DT>28<DD>But if he does not acquire the means to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and he can then go back to his property.
<DT>29<DD>"`If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time he may redeem it.
<DT>30<DD>If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.
<DT>31<DD>But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
<DT>32<DD>"`The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.
<DT>33<DD>So the property of the Levites is redeemable&#151;that is, a house sold in any town they hold&#151;and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.
<DT>34<DD>But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
<DT>35<DD>"`If one of your countrymen becomes poor and is unable to support himself among you, help him as you would an alien or a temporary resident, so he can continue to live among you.
<DT>36<DD>Do not take interest of any kind <sup>[<a href="#footnote65">65</a>]</sup> from him, but fear your God, so that your countryman may continue to live among you.
<DT>37<DD>You must not lend him money at interest or sell him food at a profit.
<DT>38<DD>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
<DT>39<DD>"`If one of your countrymen becomes poor among you and sells himself to you, do not make him work as a slave.
<DT>40<DD>He is to be treated as a hired worker or a temporary resident among you; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
<DT>41<DD>Then he and his children are to be released, and he will go back to his own clan and to the property of his forefathers.
<DT>42<DD>Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
<DT>43<DD>Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.
<DT>44<DD>"`Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves.
<DT>45<DD>You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.
<DT>46<DD>You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
<DT>47<DD>"`If an alien or a temporary resident among you becomes rich and one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells himself to the alien living among you or to a member of the alien's clan,
<DT>48<DD>he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his relatives may redeem him:
<DT>49<DD>An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
<DT>50<DD>He and his buyer are to count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for his release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired man for that number of years.
<DT>51<DD>If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption a larger share of the price paid for him.
<DT>52<DD>If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to compute that and pay for his redemption accordingly.
<DT>53<DD>He is to be treated as a man hired from year to year; you must see to it that his owner does not rule over him ruthlessly.
<DT>54<DD>"`Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,
<DT>55<DD>for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.

<DT>5<DD>Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land.

<DT>12<DD>I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.

<DT>15<DD>and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant,
<DT>16<DD>then I will do this to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and drain away your life. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it.
<DT>17<DD>I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
<DT>18<DD>"`If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over.
<DT>19<DD>I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze.
<DT>20<DD>Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit.
<DT>21<DD>"`If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve.
<DT>22<DD>I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted.
<DT>23<DD>"`If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me,
<DT>24<DD>I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over.
<DT>25<DD>And I will bring the sword upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands.
<DT>26<DD>When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be satisfied.

<DT>28<DD>then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over.
<DT>29<DD>You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
<DT>30<DD>I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.
<DT>31<DD>I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings.
<DT>32<DD>I will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be appalled.
<DT>33<DD>I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins.
<DT>34<DD>Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
<DT>35<DD>All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it.
<DT>36<DD>"`As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them.
<DT>37<DD>They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies.
<DT>38<DD>You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.
<DT>39<DD>Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their fathers' sins they will waste away.
<DT>40<DD>"`But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers&#151;their treachery against me and their hostility toward me,
<DT>41<DD>which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies&#151;then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin,
<DT>42<DD>I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
<DT>43<DD>For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees.
<DT>44<DD>Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the LORD their God.
<DT>45<DD>But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.'"
<DT>46<DD>These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="27"></A><H2>Leviticus 27</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Redeeming What Is the LORD'S</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Moses,
<DT>2<DD>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate persons to the LORD by giving equivalent values,
<DT>3<DD>set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup> of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup>;
<DT>4<DD>and if it is a female, set her value at thirty shekels. <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup>
<DT>5<DD>If it is a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup> and of a female at ten shekels. <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup>
<DT>6<DD>If it is a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> of silver and that of a female at three shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup> of silver.
<DT>7<DD>If it is a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote74">74</a>]</sup> and of a female at ten shekels.
<DT>8<DD>If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, he is to present the person to the priest, who will set the value for him according to what the man making the vow can afford.
<DT>9<DD>"`If what he vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, such an animal given to the LORD becomes holy.
<DT>10<DD>He must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if he should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy.
<DT>11<DD>If what he vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal&#151;one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD&#151;the animal must be presented to the priest,
<DT>12<DD>who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be.
<DT>13<DD>If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value.
<DT>14<DD>"`If a man dedicates his house as something holy to the LORD, the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain.
<DT>15<DD>If the man who dedicates his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become his.
<DT>16<DD>"`If a man dedicates to the LORD part of his family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it&#151;fifty shekels of silver to a homer <sup>[<a href="#footnote75">75</a>]</sup> of barley seed.
<DT>17<DD>If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains.
<DT>18<DD>But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced.
<DT>19<DD>If the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become his.
<DT>20<DD>If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed.
<DT>21<DD>When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it will become the property of the priests. <sup>[<a href="#footnote76">76</a>]</sup>
<DT>22<DD>"`If a man dedicates to the LORD a field he has bought, which is not part of his family land,
<DT>23<DD>the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as something holy to the LORD.
<DT>24<DD>In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom he bought it, the one whose land it was.
<DT>25<DD>Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
<DT>26<DD>"`No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the LORD; whether an ox <sup>[<a href="#footnote77">77</a>]</sup> or a sheep, it is the LORD's.
<DT>27<DD>If it is one of the unclean animals, he may buy it back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If he does not redeem it, it is to be sold at its set value.
<DT>28<DD>"`But nothing that a man owns and devotes <sup>[<a href="#footnote78">78</a>]</sup> to the LORD&#151;whether man or animal or family land&#151;may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.
<DT>29<DD>"`No person devoted to destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote79">79</a>]</sup> may be ransomed; he must be put to death.
<DT>30<DD>"`A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
<DT>31<DD>If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth of the value to it.
<DT>32<DD>The entire tithe of the herd and flock&#151;every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd's rod&#151;will be holy to the LORD.
<DT>33<DD>He must not pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.'" 
<DT>34<DD>These are the commands the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.</B>
