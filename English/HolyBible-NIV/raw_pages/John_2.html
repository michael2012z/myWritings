<DT>1<DD>The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth&#151;and not I only, but also all who know the truth&#151;<DT>2<DD>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever: 
<DT>3<DD>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love. 
<DT>4<DD>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.
<DT>5<DD>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
<DT>6<DD>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
<DT>7<DD>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
<DT>8<DD>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.
<DT>9<DD>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
<DT>10<DD>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.
<DT>11<DD>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
<DT>12<DD>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. 
<DT>13<DD>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</B>
