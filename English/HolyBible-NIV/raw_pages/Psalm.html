<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Psalm 1</H2>
<B><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Psalm 1 <DT>1<DD>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.
<DT>2<DD>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.
<DT>3<DD>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. 
<DT>4<DD>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
<DT>5<DD>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 
<DT>6<DD>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 2 
<DT>1<DD>Why do the nations conspire <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> and the peoples plot in vain?
<DT>2<DD>The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One. <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup>
<DT>3<DD>"Let us break their chains," they say, "and throw off their fetters." 
<DT>4<DD>The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
<DT>5<DD>Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
<DT>6<DD>"I have installed my King <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> on Zion, my holy hill."
<DT>7<DD>I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup>; today I have become your Father. <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup>
<DT>8<DD>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.
<DT>9<DD>You will rule them with an iron scepter <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup>; you will dash them to pieces like pottery." 
<DT>10<DD>Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
<DT>11<DD>Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling.
<DT>12<DD>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 3  A psalm of David. When he fled from his son Absalom.
<DT>1<DD>O LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!
<DT>2<DD>Many are saying of me, "God will not deliver him."&nbsp; <I>Selah</I> <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> 
<DT>3<DD>But you are a shield around me, O LORD; you bestow glory on me and lift <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup> up my head.
<DT>4<DD>To the LORD I cry aloud, and he answers me from his holy hill.&nbsp; <I>Selah</I> 
<DT>5<DD>I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.
<DT>6<DD>I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side. 
<DT>7<DD>Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. 
<DT>8<DD>From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.&nbsp; <I>Selah</I>

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 4  For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
<DT>1<DD>Answer me when I call to you, O my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; be merciful to me and hear my prayer. 
<DT>2<DD>How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup>? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup>?&nbsp; <I>Selah</I>
<DT>3<DD>Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD will hear when I call to him. 
<DT>4<DD>In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. &nbsp; <I>Selah</I>
<DT>5<DD>Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD. 
<DT>6<DD>Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.
<DT>7<DD>You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.
<DT>8<DD>I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="5"></A><H2>Psalm 5</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Psalm 5  For the director of music. For flutes. A psalm of David.
<DT>1<DD>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.
<DT>2<DD>Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
<DT>3<DD>In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation. 
<DT>4<DD>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.
<DT>5<DD>The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.
<DT>6<DD>You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors. 
<DT>7<DD>But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.
<DT>8<DD>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies&#151;make straight your way before me. 
<DT>9<DD>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.
<DT>10<DD>Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. 
<DT>11<DD>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
<DT>12<DD>For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 6  For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to <I>sheminith.</I> <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup> A psalm of David.
<DT>1<DD>O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
<DT>2<DD>Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am faint; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are in agony.
<DT>3<DD>My soul is in anguish. How long, O LORD, how long? 
<DT>4<DD>Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.
<DT>5<DD>No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup>? 
<DT>6<DD>I am worn out from groaning; all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
<DT>7<DD>My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes. 
<DT>8<DD>Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping.
<DT>9<DD>The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.
<DT>10<DD>All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="7"></A><H2>Psalm 7</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Psalm 7  A <I>shiggaion</I> <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup> of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjamite.
<DT>1<DD>O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
<DT>2<DD>or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. 
<DT>3<DD>O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands&#151;
<DT>4<DD>if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe&#151;
<DT>5<DD>then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.&nbsp; <I>Selah</I> 
<DT>6<DD>Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.
<DT>7<DD>Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;
<DT>8<DD>let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.
<DT>9<DD>O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure. 
<DT>10<DD>My shield <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup> is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.
<DT>11<DD>God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.
<DT>12<DD>If he does not relent, he <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup> will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
<DT>13<DD>He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows. 
<DT>14<DD>He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.
<DT>15<DD>He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.
<DT>16<DD>The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head. 
<DT>17<DD>I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.

<DT>1<DD>O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!  You have set your glory above the heavens.
<DT>2<DD>From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup> because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. 
<DT>3<DD>When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
<DT>4<DD>what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?
<DT>5<DD>You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings <sup>[<a href="#footnote18">18</a>]</sup> and crowned him with glory and honor. 
<DT>6<DD>You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet:

<DT>1<DD>I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders.
<DT>2<DD>I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. 
<DT>3<DD>My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.
<DT>4<DD>For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.
<DT>5<DD>You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
<DT>6<DD>Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished. 
<DT>7<DD>The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
<DT>8<DD>He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.
<DT>9<DD>The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
<DT>10<DD>Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you. 
<DT>11<DD>Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.
<DT>12<DD>For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted. 
<DT>13<DD>O LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
<DT>14<DD>that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.
<DT>15<DD>The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 10  <sup>[<a href="#footnote22">22</a>]</sup> 
<DT>1<DD>Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? 
<DT>2<DD>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.
<DT>3<DD>He boasts of the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.
<DT>4<DD>In his pride the wicked does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
<DT>5<DD>His ways are always prosperous; he is haughty and your laws are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.
<DT>6<DD>He says to himself, "Nothing will shake me; I'll always be happy and never have trouble."
<DT>7<DD>His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.
<DT>8<DD>He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent, watching in secret for his victims.
<DT>9<DD>He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
<DT>10<DD>His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.
<DT>11<DD>He says to himself, "God has forgotten; he covers his face and never sees." 
<DT>12<DD>Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.
<DT>13<DD>Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, "He won't call me to account"?
<DT>14<DD>But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
<DT>15<DD>Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out. 
<DT>16<DD>The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.
<DT>17<DD>You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
<DT>18<DD>defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.

<DT>1<DD>In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain.
<DT>2<DD>For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
<DT>3<DD>When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do <sup>[<a href="#footnote23">23</a>]</sup>?" 
<DT>4<DD>The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them.

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 18  For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. He sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
<DT>1<DD>I love you, O LORD, my strength. 
<DT>2<DD>The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote33">33</a>]</sup> of my salvation, my stronghold.
<DT>3<DD>I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies. 
<DT>4<DD>The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
<DT>5<DD>The cords of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote34">34</a>]</sup> coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.
<DT>6<DD>In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. 
<DT>7<DD>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.
<DT>8<DD>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.
<DT>9<DD>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.
<DT>10<DD>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
<DT>11<DD>He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him&#151;the dark rain clouds of the sky.
<DT>12<DD>Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
<DT>13<DD>The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. <sup>[<a href="#footnote35">35</a>]</sup>
<DT>14<DD>He shot his arrows and scattered [the enemies], great bolts of lightning and routed them.
<DT>15<DD>The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. 
<DT>16<DD>He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.
<DT>17<DD>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.
<DT>18<DD>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.
<DT>19<DD>He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. 
<DT>20<DD>The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
<DT>21<DD>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.
<DT>22<DD>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.
<DT>23<DD>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
<DT>24<DD>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 
<DT>25<DD>To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
<DT>26<DD>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
<DT>27<DD>You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
<DT>28<DD>You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.
<DT>29<DD>With your help I can advance against a troop <sup>[<a href="#footnote36">36</a>]</sup>; with my God I can scale a wall. 
<DT>30<DD>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
<DT>31<DD>For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?
<DT>32<DD>It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
<DT>33<DD>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.
<DT>34<DD>He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
<DT>35<DD>You give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me; you stoop down to make me great.
<DT>36<DD>You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn. 
<DT>37<DD>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
<DT>38<DD>I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
<DT>39<DD>You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.
<DT>40<DD>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
<DT>41<DD>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them&#151;to the LORD, but he did not answer.
<DT>42<DD>I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets. 
<DT>43<DD>You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me.
<DT>44<DD>As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me.
<DT>45<DD>They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds. 
<DT>46<DD>The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!
<DT>47<DD>He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me,
<DT>48<DD>who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.
<DT>49<DD>Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O LORD; I will sing praises to your name.
<DT>50<DD>He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.

<DT>1<DD>As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.
<DT>2<DD>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?
<DT>3<DD>My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
<DT>4<DD>These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng. 
<DT>5<DD>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and

<DT>8<DD>By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me&#151;a prayer to the God of my life. 
<DT>9<DD>I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"
<DT>10<DD>My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"

<DT>1<DD>We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.
<DT>2<DD>With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.
<DT>3<DD>It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them. 
<DT>4<DD>You are my King and my God, who decrees <sup>[<a href="#footnote80">80</a>]</sup> victories for Jacob.
<DT>5<DD>Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.
<DT>6<DD>I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;

<DT>8<DD>In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever.&nbsp; <I>Selah</I>

<DT>12<DD>You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale. 
<DT>13<DD>You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.
<DT>14<DD>You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.
<DT>15<DD>My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame
<DT>16<DD>at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge. 
<DT>17<DD>All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.
<DT>18<DD>Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.
<DT>19<DD>But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness. 
<DT>20<DD>If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
<DT>21<DD>would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?
<DT>22<DD>Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. 
<DT>23<DD>Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
<DT>24<DD>Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression? 
<DT>25<DD>We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.

<DT>1<DD>Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,

<DT>3<DD>My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.

<DT>5<DD>Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me&#151;

<DT>7<DD>No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him&#151;
<DT>8<DD>the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough&#151;

<DT>1<DD>Psalm 73  A psalm of Asaph.
<DT>1<DD>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. 
<DT>2<DD>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.
<DT>3<DD>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
<DT>4<DD>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup>[<a href="#footnote136">136</a>]</sup>
<DT>5<DD>They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.
<DT>6<DD>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.
<DT>7<DD>From their callous hearts comes iniquity <sup>[<a href="#footnote137">137</a>]</sup>; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.
<DT>8<DD>They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.
<DT>9<DD>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.
<DT>10<DD>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup>[<a href="#footnote138">138</a>]</sup>
<DT>11<DD>They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?" 
<DT>12<DD>This is what the wicked are like&#151;always carefree, they increase in wealth. 
<DT>13<DD>Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.
<DT>14<DD>All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning. 
<DT>15<DD>If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.
<DT>16<DD>When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me
<DT>17<DD>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny. 
<DT>18<DD>Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
<DT>19<DD>How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
<DT>20<DD>As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies. 
<DT>21<DD>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,
<DT>22<DD>I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. 
<DT>23<DD>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
<DT>24<DD>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.
<DT>25<DD>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
<DT>26<DD>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 
<DT>27<DD>Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.

<DT>7<DD>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.

<DT>11<DD>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them! 
<DT>12<DD>But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.
<DT>13<DD>It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
<DT>14<DD>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.
<DT>15<DD>It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.
<DT>16<DD>The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.
<DT>17<DD>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter. 
<DT>18<DD>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.
<DT>19<DD>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
<DT>20<DD>Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
<DT>21<DD>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name. 
<DT>22<DD>Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.

<DT>4<DD>You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.

<DT>1<DD>O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.
<DT>2<DD>I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old&#151;
<DT>3<DD>what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.
<DT>4<DD>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.
<DT>5<DD>He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,
<DT>6<DD>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.
<DT>7<DD>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
<DT>8<DD>They would not be like their forefathers&#151;a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. 
<DT>9<DD>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;
<DT>10<DD>they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.
<DT>11<DD>They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.
<DT>12<DD>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
<DT>13<DD>He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.
<DT>14<DD>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.
<DT>15<DD>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
<DT>16<DD>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. 
<DT>17<DD>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
<DT>18<DD>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.
<DT>19<DD>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?
<DT>20<DD>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"
<DT>21<DD>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
<DT>22<DD>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
<DT>23<DD>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
<DT>24<DD>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
<DT>25<DD>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
<DT>26<DD>He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.
<DT>27<DD>He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.
<DT>28<DD>He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.
<DT>29<DD>They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.
<DT>30<DD>But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,
<DT>31<DD>God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. 
<DT>32<DD>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
<DT>33<DD>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.
<DT>34<DD>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.
<DT>35<DD>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
<DT>36<DD>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;
<DT>37<DD>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
<DT>38<DD>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
<DT>39<DD>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. 
<DT>40<DD>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!
<DT>41<DD>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
<DT>42<DD>They did not remember his power&#151;the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
<DT>43<DD>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
<DT>44<DD>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.
<DT>45<DD>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
<DT>46<DD>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
<DT>47<DD>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
<DT>48<DD>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
<DT>49<DD>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility&#151;a band of destroying angels.
<DT>50<DD>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.
<DT>51<DD>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
<DT>52<DD>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.
<DT>53<DD>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
<DT>54<DD>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
<DT>55<DD>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. 
<DT>56<DD>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
<DT>57<DD>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
<DT>58<DD>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
<DT>59<DD>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.
<DT>60<DD>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.
<DT>61<DD>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
<DT>62<DD>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.
<DT>63<DD>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;
<DT>64<DD>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. 
<DT>65<DD>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.
<DT>66<DD>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.
<DT>67<DD>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
<DT>68<DD>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
<DT>69<DD>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
<DT>70<DD>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;

<DT>10<DD>Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,
<DT>11<DD>for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.
<DT>12<DD>So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
<DT>13<DD>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.

<DT>29<DD>He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.
<DT>30<DD>They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.
<DT>31<DD>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.

<DT>33<DD>He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,
<DT>34<DD>and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
<DT>35<DD>He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;
<DT>36<DD>there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.
<DT>37<DD>They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;
<DT>38<DD>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish. 
<DT>39<DD>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;
<DT>40<DD>he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.

<DT>42<DD>The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.

<DT>2<DD>you who minister in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 
<DT>3<DD>Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
<DT>4<DD>For the LORD has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession. 
<DT>5<DD>I know that the LORD is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods.
<DT>6<DD>The LORD does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.
<DT>7<DD>He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. 
<DT>8<DD>He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of men and animals.
<DT>9<DD>He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
<DT>10<DD>He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings&#151;
<DT>11<DD>Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan and all the kings of Canaan&#151;
<DT>12<DD>and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel. 
<DT>13<DD>Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, through all generations.
<DT>14<DD>For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants. 
<DT>15<DD>The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
<DT>16<DD>They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;
<DT>17<DD>they have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.
<DT>18<DD>Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. 
<DT>19<DD>O house of Israel, praise the LORD; O house of Aaron, praise the LORD;
<DT>20<DD>O house of Levi, praise the LORD; you who fear him, praise the LORD.
<DT>21<DD>Praise be to the LORD from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem.  Praise the LORD.
