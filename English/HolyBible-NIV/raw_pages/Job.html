<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Job 1</H2>
<B><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Prologue</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.<DT>2<DD>He had seven sons and three daughters,
<DT>3<DD>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
<DT>4<DD>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
<DT>5<DD>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.

<DT><BR><I>Job's First Test</I><P><DD>

<DT>6<DD>One day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> also came with them.
<DT>7<DD>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
<DT>8<DD>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
<DT>9<DD>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
<DT>10<DD>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
<DT>11<DD>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
<DT>12<DD>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
<DT>13<DD>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
<DT>14<DD>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
<DT>15<DD>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
<DT>16<DD>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
<DT>17<DD>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
<DT>18<DD>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
<DT>19<DD>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
<DT>20<DD>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
<DT>21<DD>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. <sup>[<a href="#footnote3">3</a>]</sup> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
<DT>22<DD>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="2"></A><H2>Job 2</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Job's Second Test</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>On another day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote4">4</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
<DT>2<DD>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
<DT>3<DD>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
<DT>4<DD>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
<DT>5<DD>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
<DT>6<DD>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
<DT>7<DD>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
<DT>8<DD>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
<DT>9<DD>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
<DT>10<DD>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish <sup>[<a href="#footnote5">5</a>]</sup> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said. 

<DT><BR><I>Job's Three Friends</I><P><DD>

<DT>11<DD>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
<DT>12<DD>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
<DT>13<DD>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="3"></A><H2>Job 3</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Job Speaks</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
<DT>2<DD>He said:
<DT>3<DD>"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'
<DT>4<DD>That day&#151;may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.
<DT>5<DD>May darkness and deep shadow <sup>[<a href="#footnote6">6</a>]</sup> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.
<DT>6<DD>That night&#151;may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
<DT>7<DD>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
<DT>8<DD>May those who curse days <sup>[<a href="#footnote7">7</a>]</sup> curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
<DT>9<DD>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
<DT>10<DD>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. 
<DT>11<DD>"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
<DT>12<DD>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
<DT>13<DD>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
<DT>14<DD>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
<DT>15<DD>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
<DT>16<DD>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
<DT>17<DD>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
<DT>18<DD>Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
<DT>19<DD>The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master. 
<DT>20<DD>"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
<DT>21<DD>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
<DT>22<DD>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
<DT>23<DD>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
<DT>24<DD>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.
<DT>25<DD>What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
<DT>26<DD>I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="4"></A><H2>Job 4</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Eliphaz</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
<DT>2<DD>"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
<DT>3<DD>Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
<DT>4<DD>Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
<DT>5<DD>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
<DT>6<DD>Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? 
<DT>7<DD>"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
<DT>8<DD>As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
<DT>9<DD>At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.
<DT>10<DD>The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
<DT>11<DD>The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 
<DT>12<DD>"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
<DT>13<DD>Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
<DT>14<DD>fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
<DT>15<DD>A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
<DT>16<DD>It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:
<DT>17<DD>`Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
<DT>18<DD>If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
<DT>19<DD>how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
<DT>20<DD>Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
<DT>21<DD>Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?' <sup>[<a href="#footnote8">8</a>]</sup> 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="5"></A><H2>Job 5</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
<DT>2<DD>Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
<DT>3<DD>I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
<DT>4<DD>His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
<DT>5<DD>The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
<DT>6<DD>For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
<DT>7<DD>Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. 
<DT>8<DD>"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
<DT>9<DD>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
<DT>10<DD>He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.
<DT>11<DD>The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
<DT>12<DD>He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
<DT>13<DD>He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
<DT>14<DD>Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
<DT>15<DD>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
<DT>16<DD>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth. 
<DT>17<DD>"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote9">9</a>]</sup>
<DT>18<DD>For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
<DT>19<DD>From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.
<DT>20<DD>In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
<DT>21<DD>You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
<DT>22<DD>You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
<DT>23<DD>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
<DT>24<DD>You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
<DT>25<DD>You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
<DT>26<DD>You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season. 
<DT>27<DD>"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="6"></A><H2>Job 6</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Job</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Then Job replied:
<DT>2<DD>"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
<DT>3<DD>It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas&#151;no wonder my words have been impetuous.
<DT>4<DD>The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.
<DT>5<DD>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
<DT>6<DD>Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg <sup>[<a href="#footnote10">10</a>]</sup>?
<DT>7<DD>I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill. 
<DT>8<DD>"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,
<DT>9<DD>that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!
<DT>10<DD>Then I would still have this consolation&#151;my joy in unrelenting pain&#151;that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. 
<DT>11<DD>"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
<DT>12<DD>Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
<DT>13<DD>Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me? 
<DT>14<DD>"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
<DT>15<DD>But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
<DT>16<DD>when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
<DT>17<DD>but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
<DT>18<DD>Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.
<DT>19<DD>The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
<DT>20<DD>They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
<DT>21<DD>Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
<DT>22<DD>Have I ever said, `Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
<DT>23<DD>deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'? 
<DT>24<DD>"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
<DT>25<DD>How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
<DT>26<DD>Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
<DT>27<DD>You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend. 
<DT>28<DD>"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
<DT>29<DD>Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake. <sup>[<a href="#footnote11">11</a>]</sup>
<DT>30<DD>Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice? 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="7"></A><H2>Job 7</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT>1<DD>"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?
<DT>2<DD>Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,
<DT>3<DD>so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
<DT>4<DD>When I lie down I think, `How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
<DT>5<DD>My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering. 
<DT>6<DD>"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
<DT>7<DD>Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.
<DT>8<DD>The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.
<DT>9<DD>As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote12">12</a>]</sup> does not return.
<DT>10<DD>He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more. 
<DT>11<DD>"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
<DT>12<DD>Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?
<DT>13<DD>When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
<DT>14<DD>even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
<DT>15<DD>so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
<DT>16<DD>I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning. 
<DT>17<DD>"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,
<DT>18<DD>that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?
<DT>19<DD>Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
<DT>20<DD>If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? <sup>[<a href="#footnote13">13</a>]</sup>
<DT>21<DD>Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="8"></A><H2>Job 8</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Bildad</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
<DT>2<DD>"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
<DT>3<DD>Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
<DT>4<DD>When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
<DT>5<DD>But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,
<DT>6<DD>if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.
<DT>7<DD>Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be. 
<DT>8<DD>"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,
<DT>9<DD>for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.
<DT>10<DD>Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
<DT>11<DD>Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
<DT>12<DD>While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
<DT>13<DD>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
<DT>14<DD>What he trusts in is fragile <sup>[<a href="#footnote14">14</a>]</sup>; what he relies on is a spider's web.
<DT>15<DD>He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.
<DT>16<DD>He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
<DT>17<DD>it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
<DT>18<DD>But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, `I never saw you.'
<DT>19<DD>Surely its life withers away, and <sup>[<a href="#footnote15">15</a>]</sup> from the soil other plants grow. 
<DT>20<DD>"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
<DT>21<DD>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
<DT>22<DD>Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="9"></A><H2>Job 9</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Job</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Then Job replied:
<DT>2<DD>"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?
<DT>3<DD>Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
<DT>4<DD>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
<DT>5<DD>He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
<DT>6<DD>He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
<DT>7<DD>He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
<DT>8<DD>He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
<DT>9<DD>He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
<DT>10<DD>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
<DT>11<DD>When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
<DT>12<DD>If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, `What are you doing?'
<DT>13<DD>God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. 
<DT>14<DD>"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
<DT>15<DD>Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
<DT>16<DD>Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
<DT>17<DD>He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
<DT>18<DD>He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
<DT>19<DD>If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him <sup>[<a href="#footnote16">16</a>]</sup>?
<DT>20<DD>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. 
<DT>21<DD>"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
<DT>22<DD>It is all the same; that is why I say, `He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
<DT>23<DD>When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.
<DT>24<DD>When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it? 
<DT>25<DD>"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
<DT>26<DD>They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.
<DT>27<DD>If I say, `I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'
<DT>28<DD>I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
<DT>29<DD>Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
<DT>30<DD>Even if I washed myself with soap <sup>[<a href="#footnote17">17</a>]</sup> and my hands with washing soda,
<DT>31<DD>you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me. 
<DT>32<DD>"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
<DT>33<DD>If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,
<DT>34<DD>someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
<DT>35<DD>Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="10"></A><H2>Job 10</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
<DT>2<DD>I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.
<DT>3<DD>Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?
<DT>4<DD>Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?

<DT>12<DD>You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit. 
<DT>13<DD>"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:

<DT>17<DD>You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.

<DT>4<DD>You say to God, `My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'
<DT>5<DD>Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you
<DT>6<DD>and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin. 
<DT>7<DD>"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
<DT>8<DD>They are higher than the heavens&#151;what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote20">20</a>]</sup>&#151;what can you know?
<DT>9<DD>Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.

<DT>17<DD>Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.
<DT>18<DD>You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.

<DT>4<DD>"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered&#151;a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!
<DT>5<DD>Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.

<DT>4<DD>You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!
<DT>5<DD>If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.
<DT>6<DD>Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.

<DT>9<DD>Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?
<DT>10<DD>He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.

<DT>4<DD>Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!

<DT>4<DD>But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.

<DT>5<DD>Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.
<DT>6<DD>When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.
<DT>7<DD>Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
<DT>8<DD>They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.
<DT>9<DD>Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.
<DT>10<DD>Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
<DT>11<DD>They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.
<DT>12<DD>They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.
<DT>13<DD>They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote43">43</a>]</sup> in peace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote44">44</a>]</sup>

<DT>15<DD>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'
<DT>16<DD>But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked. 
<DT>17<DD>"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?
<DT>18<DD>How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?

<DT>4<DD>"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
<DT>5<DD>Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
<DT>6<DD>You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.
<DT>7<DD>You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,
<DT>8<DD>though you were a powerful man, owning land&#151;an honored man, living on it.

<DT>10<DD>That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,

<DT>15<DD>Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?
<DT>16<DD>They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.
<DT>17<DD>They said to God, `Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'
<DT>18<DD>Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked. 
<DT>19<DD>"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,

<DT>21<DD>"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.
<DT>22<DD>Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.
<DT>23<DD>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent

<DT>25<DD>then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.
<DT>26<DD>Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
<DT>27<DD>You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
<DT>28<DD>What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.
<DT>29<DD>When men are brought low and you say, `Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.

<DT>10<DD>But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
<DT>11<DD>My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
<DT>12<DD>I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread. 
<DT>13<DD>"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.
<DT>14<DD>He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.
<DT>15<DD>That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.

<DT>3<DD>They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.
<DT>4<DD>They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
<DT>5<DD>Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.
<DT>6<DD>They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
<DT>7<DD>Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.

<DT>9<DD>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
<DT>10<DD>Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
<DT>11<DD>They crush olives among the terraces <sup>[<a href="#footnote51">51</a>]</sup>; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.

<DT>15<DD>The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, `No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.
<DT>16<DD>In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.
<DT>17<DD>For all of them, deep darkness is their morning <sup>[<a href="#footnote52">52</a>]</sup>; they make friends with the terrors of darkness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote53">53</a>]</sup>

<DT>20<DD>The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.
<DT>21<DD>They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.

<DT>22<DD>then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.
<DT>23<DD>For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things. 
<DT>24<DD>"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, `You are my security,'
<DT>25<DD>if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,
<DT>26<DD>if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
<DT>27<DD>so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
<DT>28<DD>then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high. 
<DT>29<DD>"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him&#151;
<DT>30<DD>I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life&#151;
<DT>31<DD>if the men of my household have never said, `Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'&#151;
<DT>32<DD>but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler&#151;
<DT>33<DD>if I have concealed my sin as men do, <sup>[<a href="#footnote67">67</a>]</sup> by hiding my guilt in my heart
<DT>34<DD>because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside 
<DT>35<DD>("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense&#151;let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
<DT>36<DD>Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.
<DT>37<DD>I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)&#151;
<DT>38<DD>"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,

<DT><I>Elihu</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
<DT>2<DD>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
<DT>3<DD>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. <sup>[<a href="#footnote68">68</a>]</sup>
<DT>4<DD>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
<DT>5<DD>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
<DT>6<DD>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.
<DT>7<DD>I thought, `Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'
<DT>8<DD>But it is the spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote69">69</a>]</sup> in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
<DT>9<DD>It is not only the old <sup>[<a href="#footnote70">70</a>]</sup> who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. 
<DT>10<DD>"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
<DT>11<DD>I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,
<DT>12<DD>I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
<DT>13<DD>Do not say, `We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'
<DT>14<DD>But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. 
<DT>15<DD>"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
<DT>16<DD>Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
<DT>17<DD>I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
<DT>18<DD>For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;
<DT>19<DD>inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.
<DT>20<DD>I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
<DT>21<DD>I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;
<DT>22<DD>for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away. 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="33"></A><H2>Job 33</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.
<DT>2<DD>I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
<DT>3<DD>My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
<DT>4<DD>The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
<DT>5<DD>Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.
<DT>6<DD>I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.
<DT>7<DD>No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you. 
<DT>8<DD>"But you have said in my hearing&#151;I heard the very words&#151;
<DT>9<DD>`I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.
<DT>10<DD>Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
<DT>11<DD>He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.' 
<DT>12<DD>"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.
<DT>13<DD>Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words <sup>[<a href="#footnote71">71</a>]</sup>?
<DT>14<DD>For God does speak&#151;now one way, now another&#151;though man may not perceive it.
<DT>15<DD>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,
<DT>16<DD>he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,
<DT>17<DD>to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
<DT>18<DD>to preserve his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote72">72</a>]</sup> his life from perishing by the sword. <sup>[<a href="#footnote73">73</a>]</sup>
<DT>19<DD>Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,
<DT>20<DD>so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.
<DT>21<DD>His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.
<DT>22<DD>His soul draws near to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote74">74</a>]</sup> and his life to the messengers of death. <sup>[<a href="#footnote75">75</a>]</sup> 
<DT>23<DD>"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
<DT>24<DD>to be gracious to him and say, `Spare him from going down to the pit <sup>[<a href="#footnote76">76</a>]</sup>; I have found a ransom for him'&#151;
<DT>25<DD>then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.
<DT>26<DD>He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.
<DT>27<DD>Then he comes to men and says, `I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.
<DT>28<DD>He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote77">77</a>]</sup> and I will live to enjoy the light.' 
<DT>29<DD>"God does all these things to a man&#151;twice, even three times&#151;
<DT>30<DD>to turn back his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote78">78</a>]</sup> that the light of life may shine on him. 
<DT>31<DD>"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
<DT>32<DD>If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.
<DT>33<DD>But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom." 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="34"></A><H2>Job 34</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Then Elihu said:
<DT>2<DD>"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.
<DT>3<DD>For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
<DT>4<DD>Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. 
<DT>5<DD>"Job says, `I am innocent, but God denies me justice.
<DT>6<DD>Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'
<DT>7<DD>What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
<DT>8<DD>He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.
<DT>9<DD>For he says, `It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.' 
<DT>10<DD>"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
<DT>11<DD>He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.
<DT>12<DD>It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.
<DT>13<DD>Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
<DT>14<DD>If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote79">79</a>]</sup> and breath,
<DT>15<DD>all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust. 
<DT>16<DD>"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
<DT>17<DD>Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
<DT>18<DD>Is he not the One who says to kings, `You are worthless,' and to nobles, `You are wicked,'
<DT>19<DD>who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
<DT>20<DD>They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. 
<DT>21<DD>"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.
<DT>22<DD>There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.
<DT>23<DD>God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.
<DT>24<DD>Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
<DT>25<DD>Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
<DT>26<DD>He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,
<DT>27<DD>because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
<DT>28<DD>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.
<DT>29<DD>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,
<DT>30<DD>to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people. 
<DT>31<DD>"Suppose a man says to God, `I am guilty but will offend no more.
<DT>32<DD>Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'
<DT>33<DD>Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. 
<DT>34<DD>"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,
<DT>35<DD>`Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'
<DT>36<DD>Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!
<DT>37<DD>To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God." 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="35"></A><H2>Job 35</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Then Elihu said:
<DT>2<DD>"Do you think this is just? You say, `I will be cleared by God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote80">80</a>]</sup>'
<DT>3<DD>Yet you ask him, `What profit is it to me, <sup>[<a href="#footnote81">81</a>]</sup> and what do I gain by not sinning?' 
<DT>4<DD>"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
<DT>5<DD>Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
<DT>6<DD>If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
<DT>7<DD>If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?
<DT>8<DD>Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men. 
<DT>9<DD>"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
<DT>10<DD>But no one says, `Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
<DT>11<DD>who teaches more to us than to <sup>[<a href="#footnote82">82</a>]</sup> the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than <sup>[<a href="#footnote83">83</a>]</sup> the birds of the air?'
<DT>12<DD>He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
<DT>13<DD>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.
<DT>14<DD>How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,
<DT>15<DD>and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote84">84</a>]</sup>
<DT>16<DD>So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words." 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="36"></A><H2>Job 36</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>Elihu continued:
<DT>2<DD>"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.
<DT>3<DD>I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
<DT>4<DD>Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you. 
<DT>5<DD>"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
<DT>6<DD>He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
<DT>7<DD>He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
<DT>8<DD>But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,
<DT>9<DD>he tells them what they have done&#151;that they have sinned arrogantly.
<DT>10<DD>He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
<DT>11<DD>If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
<DT>12<DD>But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword <sup>[<a href="#footnote85">85</a>]</sup> and die without knowledge. 
<DT>13<DD>"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
<DT>14<DD>They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.
<DT>15<DD>But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction. 
<DT>16<DD>"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
<DT>17<DD>But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
<DT>18<DD>Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
<DT>19<DD>Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
<DT>20<DD>Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes. <sup>[<a href="#footnote86">86</a>]</sup>
<DT>21<DD>Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction. 
<DT>22<DD>"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
<DT>23<DD>Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, `You have done wrong'?
<DT>24<DD>Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.
<DT>25<DD>All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.
<DT>26<DD>How great is God&#151;beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out. 
<DT>27<DD>"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams <sup>[<a href="#footnote87">87</a>]</sup>;
<DT>28<DD>the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.
<DT>29<DD>Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?
<DT>30<DD>See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.
<DT>31<DD>This is the way he governs <sup>[<a href="#footnote88">88</a>]</sup> the nations and provides food in abundance.
<DT>32<DD>He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
<DT>33<DD>His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach. <sup>[<a href="#footnote89">89</a>]</sup> 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="37"></A><H2>Job 37</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
<DT>2<DD>Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
<DT>3<DD>He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
<DT>4<DD>After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.
<DT>5<DD>God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.
<DT>6<DD>He says to the snow, `Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, `Be a mighty downpour.'
<DT>7<DD>So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor. <sup>[<a href="#footnote90">90</a>]</sup>
<DT>8<DD>The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.
<DT>9<DD>The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.
<DT>10<DD>The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.
<DT>11<DD>He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.
<DT>12<DD>At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
<DT>13<DD>He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth <sup>[<a href="#footnote91">91</a>]</sup> and show his love. 
<DT>14<DD>"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.
<DT>15<DD>Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
<DT>16<DD>Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?
<DT>17<DD>You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
<DT>18<DD>can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? 
<DT>19<DD>"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
<DT>20<DD>Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?
<DT>21<DD>Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
<DT>22<DD>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.
<DT>23<DD>The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.

</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="40"></A><H2>Job 40</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>The LORD said to Job:
<DT>2<DD>"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"
<DT>3<DD>Then Job answered the LORD:
<DT>4<DD>"I am unworthy&#151;how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
<DT>5<DD>I spoke once, but I have no answer&#151;twice, but I will say no more."
<DT>6<DD>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:
<DT>7<DD>"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. 
<DT>8<DD>"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
<DT>9<DD>Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?
<DT>10<DD>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
<DT>11<DD>Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,
<DT>12<DD>look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.
<DT>13<DD>Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
<DT>14<DD>Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you. 
<DT>15<DD>"Look at the behemoth, <sup>[<a href="#footnote101">101</a>]</sup> which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.
<DT>16<DD>What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!
<DT>17<DD>His tail <sup>[<a href="#footnote102">102</a>]</sup> sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.
<DT>18<DD>His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.
<DT>19<DD>He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.
<DT>20<DD>The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.
<DT>21<DD>Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
<DT>22<DD>The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.
<DT>23<DD>When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
<DT>24<DD>Can anyone capture him by the eyes, <sup>[<a href="#footnote103">103</a>]</sup> or trap him and pierce his nose? 
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="41"></A><H2>Job 41</H2><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>"Can you pull in the leviathan <sup>[<a href="#footnote104">104</a>]</sup> with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
<DT>2<DD>Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
<DT>3<DD>Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?
<DT>4<DD>Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
<DT>5<DD>Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
<DT>6<DD>Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
<DT>7<DD>Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
<DT>8<DD>If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
<DT>9<DD>Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.
<DT>10<DD>No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?
<DT>11<DD>Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. 
<DT>12<DD>"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.
<DT>13<DD>Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?
<DT>14<DD>Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
<DT>15<DD>His back has <sup>[<a href="#footnote105">105</a>]</sup> rows of shields tightly sealed together;
<DT>16<DD>each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
<DT>17<DD>They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
<DT>18<DD>His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
<DT>19<DD>Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
<DT>20<DD>Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
<DT>21<DD>His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
<DT>22<DD>Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.
<DT>23<DD>The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
<DT>24<DD>His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
<DT>25<DD>When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
<DT>26<DD>The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
<DT>27<DD>Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
<DT>28<DD>Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.
<DT>29<DD>A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
<DT>30<DD>His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
<DT>31<DD>He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
<DT>32<DD>Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
<DT>33<DD>Nothing on earth is his equal&#151;a creature without fear.
<DT>34<DD>He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."
</DL><P><HR><P><A NAME="42"></A><H2>Job 42</H2><DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Job</I><P><DD>

<DT>1<DD>Then Job replied to the LORD:
<DT>2<DD>"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.
<DT>3<DD>[You asked,] `Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. 
<DT>4<DD>["You said,] `Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'
<DT>5<DD>My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
<DT>6<DD>Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes." 

<DT><BR><I>Epilogue</I><P><DD>

<DT>7<DD>After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
<DT>8<DD>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
<DT>9<DD>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
<DT>10<DD>After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.
<DT>11<DD>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver <sup>[<a href="#footnote106">106</a>]</sup> and a gold ring.
<DT>12<DD>The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.
<DT>13<DD>And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
<DT>14<DD>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.
<DT>15<DD>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.
<DT>16<DD>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
<DT>17<DD>And so he died, old and full of years.</B>
