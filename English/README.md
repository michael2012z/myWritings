I do not know where to go, but I have been on the road.

Once you meet someone, you never forget them.

I hope one day you have the courage to run away from everything that makes you miserable.

Nothing improves the memory more than trying to forget.

They say that the best blaze burns brightest when the circumstances are at the worst.
