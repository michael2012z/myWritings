# Steam Locomotives on Postage Stamps - Egypt 1933 issues

When I began to write for the "Steam Locomotives on Postage Stamps" series, I searched "railway" and "locomotive" in a Scott Classic Catalog (2006 version, E-I sections), a beautiful old engine sketch came into my sight. It was the first stamp of a set of 4, which were numbered as 168~171 in Scott catalog.

The stamps were issued to memorize International Railroad Congress held at Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo. 4 engines serving in different years were depicted on the stamps.

The first one dated back 1852. You can recognize it as a quite old and naive locomotive from its simple structure.

The second one appeared in 1859, which looks more beautiful. It was heavily decorated - look at the luxurey tender - was it a royal engine?

The third locomotive was working in 1862, which looks stronger. Although the structure was quite similar with the one on 5 mills stamp, it owned 2 large wheels in the middle of the body.

The last one was quite recent (1932) when the stamps were printed. The structure of the locomotive was like most modern engines. It had 4 leading wheels, more than every of previous ones. And it must be longer, because the tender can't even be accommodated in the stamp picture.

While I think there is a problem in the selection of locomotives to be designed. Between 1862 and 1932, no locomotive was chosen among the 70 years. There must be some development in steam locomotives. What engines were used in those years?
