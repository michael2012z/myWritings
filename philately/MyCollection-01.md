My Collection (1) - China - USA First Flight

In April 21, 1937, aftering running for one and half years. China Cliper air route was successfully extended to Hong Kong.
The aircraft was a MARTIN M-130, numbered as NC-14716, operated by Pan American Airways. The air route was known as F.A.M. 14.

The open-up of this air route was very meaningful and widely welcomed. From then on, air mails from China could choose to route to Hong Kong at first and get on board of FAM 14, which was the fastest and safest way at the time.

I own 4 first flight cover celebrating the event. All of them were sent from Shanghai, targeted somewhere in U.S..
The inaugural cover shown with Fig.1 was sent on April 26, and reached ... days later.
Fig.2 is almost a duplicate of Fig.1, just received in different place.
Fig.3 is a bit different. It failed in finding the receiver. So a "Returned to Sender" auxiliary mark applied. However, I don't know if the cover had been returned successfully, as no more marks indicated further handling of this mail.

There is no doubt that these 3 covers were all miniatures to memorise the maiden voyage of FAM 14 to Hong Kong. They were pretty designed and sealed without any letter in them. When I bought them, the envelops had never been opened.

The last one is more or less different. It seems more natural.
