Hart was appointed as Inspector-General of China's Imperial Maritime Custom Service (IMCS) in 1863. Hart's main responsibilities included collecting custom duties for the Chinese government, as well as expanding the new system to more sea and river ports and some inland frontiers, standardising its operations, and insisting on high standards of efficiency and honesty.

Hart had the ambition to establish national postal system in China by learning that of Britain.
In 1878, Robert Hart was authenticated by Zongli Yamen to set up trial-run postal service to handle public mailing. Note, it was not national postal system, but a new service provided by customs. So the offical name is Customs Postal Service.
This new service was centered in Tientsin Customs, was also available in Peking, Shanghai, Newchwang, Chinkiang. Two years later, in 1880 it was renamed as Customs Postal Office
In July 1878, Chinaâ€™s first issue - Customs Large Dragon stamps was released.

In 1895, after running postal service for dozen years, Hart thought he had been ready for establishing national post. He initiated the Postal Guide for the modern postal system and proposed his idea to Zongli Yamen.
In 1896, Robert Hart succeeded in founding the Imperial Post Office and he was appointed the Inspector General of Posts.

The first task the Imperial Post Office faced was to print a new set of stamps which would be used nation-wide. R. A. de Villard designed the stamps, 3 different design (dragon, carp and goose) applied for different values.

The stamps was printed by Waterlow & Sons Limited. This company was located in London, was a very famous printer at that time, which printed various stamps and banknotes for a number of countries.

The printing methods applied was line-engraving. The engraving jobs was delegated to 3 engravers: Coiling Dragon design was engraved by Rapkin and his son, Jumping Carp by A. B. Hill and Flying Goose by Joseph.
