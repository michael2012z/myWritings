Flying Goose Stamps (0)

If I have to choose one kind of stamp as my faverate from all stamps I've ever known, my choice must be Flying Goose Stamps.

I have a lot to say about Flying Goose Stamps.

Before telling a long story of Flying Goose Stamps, let me show you the picture of them and their family.

The photos below were taken from my collection.

The picture showed a mint Flying Goose stamp of one dollar face value. In fact, I own very few of the mint one-dollar stamps, because they are expensive. But I can afford to by used stamps, I have hundreds of used stamps.

It has two buddies with different face value, one is two-dollar and the other is 5-dollar. The mint stamps of higher face value are even more expensive, I haven't any of them.

Flying Goose Stamps were issued in the year of 1898. At that time, China was still governed by the last ancient dynasdy - Tsing. In 1896, imperial China launched postage service, and published a set of stamps two years later. 

The set were made up of x stamps with 3 sort of designs: coiling dragon, jumping carp and flying goose. Flying Goose stamps were the highest-valued, their values were in dollars, while other were in cents.
