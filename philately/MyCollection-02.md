My Collection (2)

Frequently in every sorts of books, magazines and newspapaers, philately was introduced as a hobby that extend one's knowledge. Though in my opinion, it's quite dependant on individul's custom and effert. A stamp, cover or card itself doesn't contain much information, but it reveals. One can obtain the relevant knowledge if only he/she dives in.

Collectors are born and not made. If one collect postal things, it's rather probable that he/she also gathers knowledge.

When I bought the envelop shown in Figure 1, I didn't know I will soon get to know something about NEON.

The cover was sent from Shangehai to New York. 6 stamps were used, value sums to 1.50 Yuan. It was sent on 17th Sep, 1941, and arrived at N.Y. 28th Oct, 1941. The transmission took more than 40 days. The whole envelop was well reserved, and all post marks were clear, that's the essential for a good collective.

Besides that, I also paid attention to the sender and receiver.

The letter was sent from "Claude Neon Lights", sounds like a Neon work. The address was "Rue Bourgeat" which was a road in Shanghai French Concession. The name of the road now translated to "蒲石路" at that time. Now the road has been renamed as "长乐路"。

I bet everyone of you who is reading this post have seen Neon lights some where. They are widely used by shops to attract consumers for their colorfulness. However I guess few of you can tell who invented neon.

The person who brought neon lights into birth is Georges Claude. Claude was a Frence engineer and inventor, considered by some to be "the Edison of France". He invented neon light in 1910. He filed patent on the lighting utilization of neon. The first neon light was shown in Dec 1910 at Paris Motor Show.

Claude was successful in commertial development of neon lighting technology. He set up Claude Neon in France and later extended the business to America and established Claude Neon Lights. This is verified by the envelope, under the company name there writes "Federal Inc. U.S.A.".

Pay attention to the logo with slogan "Outshines The Sunshine". I tried different searching engines to find out this logo but all failed. I guess it's not easy to discover the log nowadays, as the company had dismissed for some many decades. This cover should be a good material for neon light topical collectors.

The business of Claude Neon Lights didn't continue long. After World War II, Claude was condemned to life imprisonment for his collaboration with Nazi in designing V-1 flying bomb. But in 1950 he was released from prison, with acknowledgment of his research on ocean thermal energy conversion.

The receiver of the cover is Corning Glass Works in New York. This company is still operating now. In 1951, to celebrate its 100th anniversary, Corning Glass Works opened a museum named "The Corning Museum of Glass" to tell the storing of the development of glass. Now the museum is still open for visiting.
