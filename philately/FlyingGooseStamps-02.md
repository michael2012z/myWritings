Flying Goose Stamps (2)

Flying Goose stamps were designed by R.A.de Villard, who was an employee of China Custom.
Figure 1 showes the original design of Flying Goose stamp (1 dollar value). The central chachet (goose) and characters (Chinese, English and digit) was as same as what we see today on the stamp. But the chachet of sides was quite different.
The Flying Goose stamps I'm talking about was printed in London by Waterlow & Sons. But before the London version of stamp, another set of Flying Goose stamps were manufactured in Tokyo Japan. The Tokyo version was a temporary solution, because London version was planed to be printed in line-engraving. The engraving of master-die was quite time consuming. So a quick version made in Tokyo was introduced to fill the gap before London version was ready.
However, Tokyo version was poor in quality, as you can see in figure 2.
The design of left and right sides was same as Villard's original design, which was swastika of Buddism. In Chinese culture, such swastika emblem represts for wishes of good luck and happiness. (Note, the direction of Buddism swastika is different with Nazi's emblem.)
When Villard's design was sent to Waterlow & Sons. The company proposed an improvement. The design of swastika looked too simple. Waterlow advised to replace it with net-like design. The advantage of the suggested design came from 2 perspectives:
1. The net design was a good idea for anti-conterfeiting. It was extremely hard to copy due to the complexity.
2. The net design was beautiful. 
The net design was commonly seen in morden banknote design. As the top banknote and stamp printer around the world at the time, Waterlow was professional in providing the advice. Not surprisingly, Hart accepted the idea soon.
